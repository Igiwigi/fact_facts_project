the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta

difficult to see that this fact carries any weight at all,this,rstb_1937_0013.txt,txt_rstb
I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,this,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb

base this view on the fact that Srensio’s suggested restoration of,this,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb
region. Even if true this fact would provide no evidence of,this,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb
features go to establish the fact that this large oper- cular,this,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,this,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
This is due to the fact that they are largely determined,this,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta
this in spite of the fact that some of the measurements,this,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta
this recommendation lies in the fact that the three steps g,this,rsta_1937_0005.txt,txt_rsta
This correlation corresponds to the fact that corresponding significant entries in,this,rsta_1937_0003.txt,txt_rsta
this is due to the fact that although the sun does,this,rsta_1937_0002.txt,txt_rsta
may be taken of this fact to overcome difficulties in the,this,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb
point emerging from this experiment—the fact that movements of the contained,this,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb
this failure cannot be the fact that the females were deterred,this,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb

"outcome of this action. The fact that animals may respond, not",this,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb
This is supported by the fact that hosts containing dead second,this,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb
"already indicated, it is this fact which appears to be responsible",this,rstb_1938_0006.txt,txt_rstb
in the Peterborough Museum. The fact that so much of this,this,rstb_1938_0006.txt,txt_rstb
"even with aged plants, a fact which makes Datura in this",this,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb
of this strain is in fact admixed with the 1 source,this,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb
X¥ (see fig. 40). This fact affords further evidence for the,this,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb
“That this is indeed the fact is shown when the virus,this,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb

"acidic lava, and that this fact is valuable in volcanological diagnosis",this,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb

"may be seen from the fact that In /,(«) within this",this,rsta_1938_0005.txt,txt_rsta
This is due to the fact that when y — 7,this,rsta_1938_0004.txt,txt_rsta
the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,this,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta
Physically this corresponds to the fact that the edge of the,this,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta
This is equivalent to the fact that the ground attenuation due,this,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta
No theoretical explanation of this fact has been given. In Ptu,this,rsta_1938_0013.txt,txt_rsta

this result depends on the fact that what we have been,this,rsta_1938_0012.txt,txt_rsta
prove that this is in fact the case. It will follow,this,rsta_1938_0012.txt,txt_rsta
"have been found, and this fact gives strong support to our",this,rstb_1939_0006.txt,txt_rstb
Primula sinensis. This is in fact known to be so in,this,rstb_1939_0006.txt,txt_rstb
with this position is the fact that the cell is not,this,rstb_1939_0003.txt,txt_rstb
this is due to the fact that they lie at too,this,rstb_1939_0001.txt,txt_rstb
extrusion of the latter. This fact seems to indicate a considerable,this,rstb_1939_0001.txt,txt_rstb
above the present lake. This fact together with its generally denuded,this,rstb_1939_0001.txt,txt_rstb
This is disproved by the fact that it appears in vitro,this,rstb_1939_0002.txt,txt_rstb
But this statement disregards the fact that filtration of water through,this,rstb_1939_0005.txt,txt_rstb
This is due to the fact that the adult female is,this,rstb_1939_0004.txt,txt_rstb

owed its origin to the fact that a {110}-plane of this,this,rsta_1939_0011.txt,txt_rsta
or vice versa. In this fact is probably to be found,this,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta
this theory based on the fact that the estimated tempera- tures,this,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta
this is evident from the fact that the relationship which had,this,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta
"maximum in this phase, a fact probably attributable to a local",this,rstb_1940_0001.txt,txt_rstb
itself. It is a striking fact that the silts of this,this,rstb_1940_0001.txt,txt_rstb
this corresponds obviously to the fact that we are dealing with,this,rsta_1940_0009.txt,txt_rsta
genuine. This consists in the fact that the curve for liquid,this,rsta_1940_0009.txt,txt_rsta
"not conclusive, points to the fact that this may be the",this,rsta_1940_0009.txt,txt_rsta
"quantity for the /,-spectra. This fact makes it almost impossible to",this,rsta_1940_0009.txt,txt_rsta
This is due to the fact that they use the repulsive,this,rsta_1940_0005.txt,txt_rsta

"this general structure has in fact been proposed, Allicospermum (Harris 1935),",this,rstb_1941_0004.txt,txt_rstb

it may be that this fact in some way helped the,this,rstb_1942_0002.txt,txt_rstb
This was due to the fact that one portion which we,this,rstb_1944_0002.txt,txt_rstb

shows that this is in fact the case. Mitoses were generally,this,rstb_1946_0001.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,of,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,of,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta
