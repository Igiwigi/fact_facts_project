"Years 1841-1850: or other, this fact has been acknowledged",this
Years 1841-1850: alkalies render this fact of some importance.,this

"Years 1841-1850: contractions, certainly this fact alone is insufficient",this
Years 1841-1850: acting alone. This fact evidently proves that,this
"Years 1841-1850: knowledge of this fact is illus- trative,",this

Years 1841-1850: certain of this fact by means of,this

Years 1841-1850: : this in fact is nearly the,this
Years 1841-1850: being covered. This fact is rendered obvious,this
Years 1841-1850: description unnecessary. This fact is of considerable,this
"Years 1841-1850: explanations of this fact is, in my",this
Years 1841-1850: explanation of this fact involves similar phenomena,this
Years 1841-1850: This is that fact for which it,this
