Years 1888-1892: that we regard this fundamental fact to be established ; therefore
Years 1888-1892: the encephalon. 3 One fundamental fact stands out, however, prominently, viz.,
Years 1888-1892: his experiments which established the fact that nitrogen was fixed in
Years 1888-1892: post-mortem examination had established the fact that in reality it was
Years 1888-1892: other hand, there is no fact in embryology more firmly established
Years 1888-1892: that we regard this fundamental fact to be established ; therefore
Years 1888-1892: conclusion is supported by the fact that a similar rise follows
Years 1888-1892: determined. It is a curious fact that we OF THE FOSSIL
Years 1888-1892: is not only a curious fact in itself, but it is
Years 1888-1892: furnishes an illustration of the fact that hernia cerebri is apt

Years 1888-1892: Yet, even if so, the fact would have no bearing on
Years 1888-1892: to be explained by the fact that the optic radiations into
Years 1888-1892: probably be explained by the fact of such liberation. 3.—The experiments
Years 1888-1892: may be explained by the fact that the longer duration of
Years 1888-1892: be fully explained by the fact that changes in the arterial

Years 1888-1892: Sho) iar, dies" The important fact here exhibited, namely, that the
Years 1888-1892: add the hardly less important fact that no animal possesses an
Years 1888-1892: Rather more important is the fact that M. Renauur speaks of
Years 1888-1892: also indicates a very important fact which will be referred to
Years 1888-1892: is, however, one very important fact already referred to at the
Years 1888-1892: experiments which have confirmed this fact ; _ indeed, the smartest
Years 1888-1892: feeble movement was flexion. This fact we have now confirmed in

Years 1888-1892: ganglion without losing their medulla—a fact which has been confirmed by
Years 1888-1892: the establishment of the great fact of the fixation of the
Years 1888-1892: tion of combined nitrogen; in fact that there was fixation of
Years 1888-1892: the establishment of the great fact of the fixation of the
Years 1888-1892: Further, he considers that the fact of the fixation of free
Years 1888-1892: It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of
Years 1888-1892: Though it is undoubtedly a fact that some centres are more
Years 1888-1892: were divided ; the interesting fact then came to light that,
Years 1888-1892: A As a matter of fact the results thus obtained did
Years 1888-1892: ; as a matter of fact it is the dorsal ramus
Years 1888-1892: and as a matter of fact ceases when the other lateral

Years 1888-1892: again calling attention to the fact that potential at leg agreed
Years 1888-1892: I also experimentally verified the fact that, while potential at mouth

Years 1888-1892: no doubt due to the fact that the lesion was not

Years 1888-1892: may be due to the fact that the different regions of
Years 1888-1892: I believe, due to the fact that neither Gérrn, Lupwic, nor
Years 1888-1892: doubtless partly due to the fact that no manure was applied
Years 1888-1892: all probability, due to the fact that the antagonistic muscles of
Years 1888-1892: appearances are due to the fact that the cells are fusiform,
Years 1888-1892: size is due to the fact that different systems of fibres
Years 1888-1892: 57 being due to the fact that the mucous membrane is
Years 1888-1892: being evidently due to the fact that the parts with which
Years 1888-1892: is obviously due to the fact that the Ghcreased moisture has
Years 1888-1892: éase, is due to the fact that in the dorsal cord
Years 1888-1892: this is due to the fact that, apart from the few
Years 1888-1892: side, are due to the fact that the nerve investigated was
Years 1888-1892: of course, due to the fact that, on the appearance of
Years 1888-1892: no doubt due to the fact that the vaso-motor paralysis has
Years 1888-1892: however, is due to the fact that the fibres are scattered,

Years 1888-1892: might be due to the fact that the yeast-cells are now
Years 1888-1892: is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements
Years 1888-1892: once struck with the remarkable fact that, while the organ has
Years 1888-1892: But a still more remarkable fact is brought out in considering
Years 1888-1892: 0°665. It is a remarkable fact that in the case of
Years 1888-1892: time confronted with the remarkable fact that in consequence of an
Years 1888-1892: most remarkable illustrations of the fact that impulses emerge from a
Years 1888-1892: bring to light the remarkable fact that there are striking specific
Years 1888-1892: OF THE 3. The chief fact in this connection, and indeed
Years 1888-1892: this is due to the fact that, apart from the few
Years 1888-1892: advert once more to the fact that the foregoing account is
Years 1888-1892: the tubes end. In the fact that the blood is arterial
Years 1888-1892: be fully explained by the fact that changes in the arterial
Years 1888-1892: blood, in spite of the fact that the arterial pressure is
Years 1888-1892: blood in spite of the fact that the arterial pressure is
Years 1888-1892: This he attributed to the fact that, owing to the slow

Years 1888-1892: This is owing to the fact that we have now reached
Years 1888-1892: in size, owing to the fact that it is here cut
Years 1888-1892: great interest, owing to the fact that it is always possible
Years 1888-1892: all these methods is the fact that, owing to the index

Years 1888-1892: more difficult owing to the fact that improvement in the nutrition
Years 1888-1892: in fig. 16, The first fact to be noted here is
Years 1888-1892: cell, is suggested by the fact that the more pointed end,
Years 1888-1892: we would merely emphasize the fact that the anatomical connections with
Years 1888-1892: anatomical relations, and by the fact that, in order, as we
Years 1888-1892: already drawn attention to the fact that the anatomical relations of
Years 1888-1892: we would merely emphasize the fact that the anatomical connections with
Years 1888-1892: anatomical relations, and by the fact that, in order, as we
Years 1888-1892: already drawn attention to the fact that the anatomical relations of
Years 1888-1892: the shoulder muscles. Another striking fact is that the long axis
Years 1888-1892: bring to light the remarkable fact that there are striking specific
Years 1888-1892: hydrogen. But the most striking fact is that, comparing tube with
Years 1888-1892: gradually shows itself. The mere fact that in such cases the
Years 1888-1892: a certain extent, The mere fact that the centripetal fibres which
Years 1888-1892: roots, he clearly mentions the fact of the existence of isolated

Years 1888-1892: evidently point clearly to the fact that the electrical change may
Years 1888-1892: simply consists in the obvious fact that removal of the cortex
Years 1888-1892: the latter plants, beyond the fact that our fossil root most
Years 1888-1892: length of time, beyond the fact that it has always been
Years 1888-1892: influence of cold, placed this fact beyond doubt. As it is
Years 1888-1892: to these fibres, beyond the fact that such fibres come into
Years 1888-1892: place beyond all doubt the fact that the convoluted or vermiform
Years 1888-1892: case.” believe is in the fact that in the teased-out specimens,
Years 1888-1892: continuation forwards. Confirmation of the fact just stated with regard to
Years 1888-1892: opinion stated above by the fact that Professor Ferrier, in his

Years 1888-1892: made, is shown by the fact that with this weak intensity
Years 1888-1892: the experiment lies in the fact that with a weak stimulus

Years 1888-1892: fossil is the largest, that fact may help to account for
Years 1888-1892: sufficient to account for the fact that the paralysis extended to
Years 1888-1892: partly on account of the fact that the a animal had
Years 1888-1892: advert once more to the fact that the foregoing account is
Years 1888-1892: this will account for the fact that there is only a
Years 1888-1892: tion of combined nitrogen; in fact that there was fixation of
Years 1888-1892: long been drawn to the fact that, whilst sandstone casts of

Years 1888-1892: is sufficiently evident from the fact that it occurs less readily
Years 1888-1892: merely to state the actual fact without involving any cause thereof;
Years 1888-1892: other hanging on. Another peculiar fact noticed in connection with this
Years 1888-1892: consideration, The importance of this fact has already been alluded to
Years 1888-1892: on any such basis, a fact the importance of which is
Years 1888-1892: feature of importance is the fact that, in the four independent
Years 1888-1892: cannot pass by the obvious fact upon which we think we
Years 1888-1892: simply consists in the obvious fact that removal of the cortex
Years 1888-1892: no reason to doubt it—the fact just described would seem to
Years 1888-1892: condition. In view of the fact that definite variations have been
Years 1888-1892: But in view of the fact that the Anomodontia was originally
Years 1888-1892: this view lies in the fact that excitation of one hemisphere
Years 1888-1892: ginger. In view of the fact that ordinary decoctions of ginger
Years 1888-1892: roots, he clearly mentions the fact of the existence of isolated
Years 1888-1892: impossible not to recognise the fact so clearly illustrated by these
Years 1888-1892: evidently point clearly to the fact that the electrical change may
Years 1888-1892: no adequate explanation of the fact that the prominences through which
Years 1888-1892: The real explanation of this fact is, I think, that the
Years 1888-1892: But a still more remarkable fact is brought out in considering
Years 1888-1892: striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able
Years 1888-1892: always able to substantiate the fact that there was a diminution
Years 1888-1892: as is evidenced by the fact that we have been able
Years 1888-1892: those of ammonia in the fact #hat.the convulsions never assume the
Years 1888-1892: of the posterior roots. This fact led us, at first, to
Years 1888-1892: for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of
Years 1888-1892: type of Marsupial, while the fact that as many as three
Years 1888-1892: may be overcome, by the fact that many stages in ancestral
Years 1888-1892: is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements

Years 1888-1892: one reason doubtless being the fact that the portion of cord

Years 1888-1892: significance, I believe, from the fact that it divides from one
Years 1888-1892: cell, is suggested by the fact that the more pointed end,
Years 1888-1892: is perhaps strengthened by the fact that nerve-fibres (of the roots)

Years 1888-1892: groups, the puncture revealed the fact that the position of the
Years 1888-1892: this view lies in the fact that excitation of one hemisphere
Years 1888-1892: is only imperfectly bilateral, a fact of the greatest importance, as
Years 1888-1892: as is evidenced by the fact that we have been able
Years 1888-1892: appearances are due to the fact that the cells are fusiform,
