Years 1889-1893: production otherwise unexplained; and the fact of its acquisition in considerable
Years 1889-1893: agents. Lastly, he considers the fact of the acquisition of free
Years 1889-1893: clearly demonstrated by the significant fact that the presence of a
Years 1889-1893: impossible not to recognise the fact so clearly illustrated by these
Years 1889-1893: already quoted, should recognise the fact that in some examples of

Years 1889-1893: specimen sufficed to establish the fact that the Lepidodendron brevifolium was
Years 1889-1893: determined. It is a curious fact that we OF THE FOSSIL
Years 1889-1893: is not only a curious fact in itself, but it is
Years 1889-1893: chromatophores. It is a curious fact that, although these yellow chromatophores
Years 1889-1893: ® It is a curious fact that in a sinistral Flat
Years 1889-1893: is a curious and remarkable fact that there is no tendency

Years 1889-1893: is in harmony with the fact that the ventral edge of
Years 1889-1893: the tubes end. In the fact that the blood is arterial
Years 1889-1893: be fully explained by the fact that changes in the arterial
Years 1889-1893: blood, in spite of the fact that the arterial pressure is
Years 1889-1893: blood in spite of the fact that the arterial pressure is
Years 1889-1893: that we regard this fundamental fact to be established ; therefore
Years 1889-1893: the encephalon. 3 One fundamental fact stands out, however, prominently, viz.,
Years 1889-1893: is perhaps strengthened by the fact that nerve-fibres (of the roots)
Years 1889-1893: and its isomers, demonstrated the fact that by cutaneous absorption these
Years 1889-1893: stimulus was demonstrated by the fact that the placing of the
Years 1889-1893: hot water test demonstrated the fact that the animal felt much
Years 1889-1893: (20), in 1869, demonstrated the fact for the skin of the
Years 1889-1893: clearly demonstrated by the significant fact that the presence of a
Years 1889-1893: his experiments which established the fact that nitrogen was fixed in
Years 1889-1893: post-mortem examination had established the fact that in reality it was
Years 1889-1893: other hand, there is no fact in embryology more firmly established
Years 1889-1893: that we regard this fundamental fact to be established ; therefore
Years 1889-1893: form the pyramidal tracts. The fact above alluded to of the
Years 1889-1893: in strict accordance with the fact alluded to in Chapter VIII,
Years 1889-1893: inner surface is diminishing, a fact that has already been alluded
Years 1889-1893: we would merely emphasize the fact that the anatomical connections with
Years 1889-1893: anatomical relations, and by the fact that, in order, as we
Years 1889-1893: already drawn attention to the fact that the anatomical relations of
Years 1889-1893: borne in mind that the fact that no palpable difference can
Years 1889-1893: is borne out by the fact that it is the lower
Years 1889-1893: again calling attention to the fact that potential at leg agreed
Years 1889-1893: we called attention to the fact that in the experiments in
Years 1889-1893: also call attention to the fact that when the clear, filtered,

Years 1889-1893: of special mention being the fact that the middle digit is
Years 1889-1893: 311.) Ihave only a single fact to mention with regard to
Years 1889-1893: are derived, but mention the fact that the ulnar joins the
Years 1889-1893: were divided ; the interesting fact then came to light that,
Years 1889-1893: taken in conjunction with the fact that they state that there
Years 1889-1893: the establishment of the great fact of the fixation of the
Years 1889-1893: tion of combined nitrogen; in fact that there was fixation of
Years 1889-1893: the establishment of the great fact of the fixation of the
Years 1889-1893: Further, he considers that the fact of the fixation of free

Years 1889-1893: as is proved by the fact that when the entire motor

Years 1889-1893: perature, as proved by the fact that, with return of movement,
Years 1889-1893: instance is proved by the fact that on post-mortem examination there
Years 1889-1893: probably be explained by the fact of such liberation. 3.—The experiments
Years 1889-1893: may be explained by the fact that the longer duration of
Years 1889-1893: be fully explained by the fact that changes in the arterial
Years 1889-1893: not reverse with time. This fact is perhaps best explained upon
Years 1889-1893: possibly be explained by the fact that QA in these Cyprinids
Years 1889-1893: again calling attention to the fact that potential at leg agreed
Years 1889-1893: I also experimentally verified the fact that, while potential at mouth
Years 1889-1893: considers the results establish the fact that there is gain of
Years 1889-1893: agents. Lastly, he considers the fact of the acquisition of free
Years 1889-1893: Further, he considers that the fact of the fixation of free
Years 1889-1893: Yet, even if so, the fact would have no bearing on
Years 1889-1893: is entirely wanting in Platystoma—w fact which may possibly be associated
Years 1889-1893: A As a matter of fact the results thus obtained did
Years 1889-1893: ; as a matter of fact it is the dorsal ramus
Years 1889-1893: and as a matter of fact ceases when the other lateral
Years 1889-1893: ? As a matter of fact this is the case ;
Years 1889-1893: be found. As matter of fact portions of bones have been
Years 1889-1893: ‘ Lizards. Asa matter of fact the dentition of this specimen
Years 1889-1893: lake. Moreover, owing to the fact that the shells of the
Years 1889-1893: This is owing to the fact that we have now reached
Years 1889-1893: in size, owing to the fact that it is here cut
Years 1889-1893: great interest, owing to the fact that it is always possible
Years 1889-1893: all these methods is the fact that, owing to the index
Years 1889-1893: possibly be owing to the fact that I had been drawing
Years 1889-1893: more difficult owing to the fact that improvement in the nutrition
Years 1889-1893: be produced owing to the fact that the long head of
Years 1889-1893: manner, owing presumably to the fact they are taken from a
Years 1889-1893: is best understood from the fact that my notes refer to
Years 1889-1893: is easily understood by a fact of some importance to our
Years 1889-1893: were divided ; the interesting fact then came to light that,
Years 1889-1893: is shown by the interesting fact that it is possible to
Years 1889-1893: the ventral halves. An interesting fact is the distribution of pigment
Years 1889-1893: in fig. 16, The first fact to be noted here is
Years 1889-1893: the vigour of the animal—a fact noted for the Frog by
Years 1889-1893: THE COAL-MEASURES, 13 Lomatophloios. The fact to be noted here is
Years 1889-1893: pathologists have uently noted the fact that absence or deficiency of
Years 1889-1893: dermie cells, and recalling the fact that an electromotive excitatory change
Years 1889-1893: of the skin, and the fact that such electromotive force is
Years 1889-1893: Rather more important is the fact that M. Renauur speaks of
Years 1889-1893: also indicates a very important fact which will be referred to
Years 1889-1893: is, however, one very important fact already referred to at the
Years 1889-1893: its presence is an important fact in relation to the physiological
Years 1889-1893: years ago. This important physiological fact was reached indirectly by the
Years 1889-1893: in each molecule decreases. This fact has an important bearin on
Years 1889-1893: OF THE 3. The chief fact in this connection, and indeed
Years 1889-1893: a fresh illustration of the fact that the old genus Asterophyllites
Years 1889-1893: cell, is suggested by the fact that the more pointed end,
Years 1889-1893: doubtless partly due to the fact that no manure was applied
Years 1889-1893: all probability, due to the fact that the antagonistic muscles of
Years 1889-1893: appearances are due to the fact that the cells are fusiform,
Years 1889-1893: size is due to the fact that different systems of fibres
Years 1889-1893: 57 being due to the fact that the mucous membrane is
Years 1889-1893: being evidently due to the fact that the parts with which
Years 1889-1893: is obviously due to the fact that the Ghcreased moisture has
Years 1889-1893: éase, is due to the fact that in the dorsal cord
Years 1889-1893: this is due to the fact that, apart from the few
Years 1889-1893: side, are due to the fact that the nerve investigated was
Years 1889-1893: of course, due to the fact that, on the appearance of
Years 1889-1893: no doubt due to the fact that the vaso-motor paralysis has
Years 1889-1893: however, is due to the fact that the fibres are scattered,
Years 1889-1893: failures were due to the fact that at the time I
Years 1889-1893: might be due to the fact that the yeast-cells are now
Years 1889-1893: toes is due to the fact that their extensors, which also
Years 1889-1893: This is due to the fact that the temporo-sphenoidal lobe reaches
Years 1889-1893: neglected is due to the fact that ON THE ANATOMY OF
Years 1889-1893: be simply due to the fact Ulat reduation in the size
Years 1889-1893: as simply due to Bie fact that, us the organ lost
Years 1889-1893: conclusion is supported by the fact that a similar rise follows
Years 1889-1893: the shoulder muscles. Another striking fact is that the long axis
Years 1889-1893: bring to light the remarkable fact that there are striking specific
Years 1889-1893: hydrogen. But the most striking fact is that, comparing tube with
Years 1889-1893: case.” believe is in the fact that in the teased-out specimens,
Years 1889-1893: his experiments which established the fact that nitrogen was fixed in
Years 1889-1893: post-mortem examination had established the fact that in reality it was
Years 1889-1893: other hand, there is no fact in embryology more firmly established
Years 1889-1893: that we regard this fundamental fact to be established ; therefore
Years 1889-1893: advert once more to the fact that the foregoing account is
Years 1889-1893: the orange or red. The fact ascertained by KRuKENBERG that the
Years 1889-1893: no adequate explanation of the fact that the prominences through which
Years 1889-1893: The real explanation of this fact is, I think, that the
Years 1889-1893: by ny not recognizing this fact early enough, and its explanation
Years 1889-1893: furnish an explanation of the fact that very considerable manual pressure
Years 1889-1893: this is due to the fact that, apart from the few
Years 1889-1893: 0°665. It is a remarkable fact that in the case of
Years 1889-1893: time confronted with the remarkable fact that in consequence of an
Years 1889-1893: most remarkable illustrations of the fact that impulses emerge from a
Years 1889-1893: bring to light the remarkable fact that there are striking specific
Years 1889-1893: is a curious and remarkable fact that there is no tendency
Years 1889-1893: This is owing to the fact that we have now reached
Years 1889-1893: lobe-—this is shown by the fact that we have now reached
Years 1889-1893: years ago. This important physiological fact was reached indirectly by the
Years 1889-1893: time confronted with the remarkable fact that in consequence of an
Years 1889-1893: eayam sinus imparis, and the fact that, as a consequence of
Years 1889-1893: receives some support from the fact that in the allied genus
Years 1889-1893: some additional support from the fact that the bladder is everywhere
Years 1889-1893: already been drawn to the fact that recovery of pressure, after
Years 1889-1893: of resemblance lies in the fact that the recovery of pressure
Years 1889-1893: gradually shows itself. The mere fact that in such cases the
Years 1889-1893: a certain extent, The mere fact that the centripetal fibres which
Years 1889-1893: the exoceipitals; and in the fact that the sacculi ovcupy mere
Years 1889-1893: made, is shown by the fact that with this weak intensity
Years 1889-1893: the experiment lies in the fact that with a weak stimulus
Years 1889-1893: chorda tympani, shown by the fact that electrical stimulation of the
Years 1889-1893: pressure, as shown by the fact that a rise of blood
Years 1889-1893: lobe-—this is shown by the fact that we have now reached
Years 1889-1893: genus than Apterya. From the fact that, as shown by sections,
Years 1889-1893: acute, as shown by the fact that obliquely transverse sections of
Years 1889-1893: body, as shown by the fact that a vertical section through
Years 1889-1893: probable is shown by the fact that when, as some- times
Years 1889-1893: agent is shown by the fact that even when the exposed
Years 1889-1893: columns is shown by the fact that such exceptional results were
Years 1889-1893: made, is shown by the fact that with this weak intensity
Years 1889-1893: This is shown by the fact that the cord effect, 1
Years 1889-1893: experiment was shown by the fact that, after the atriotome had
Years 1889-1893: as is shown by the fact that the changes in the
Years 1889-1893: heart is shown by the fact that = those articles of
Years 1889-1893: is shown by the interesting fact that it is possible to
Years 1889-1893: nitri with the hemoglobin. The fact that later observers have shown
Years 1889-1893: have shown that this last fact is exemplified even more strikingly
Years 1889-1893: we would merely emphasize the fact that the anatomical connections with
Years 1889-1893: anatomical relations, and by the fact that, in order, as we

Years 1889-1893: the strength of the stimulus—a fact already noticed by ENGELMANN in
Years 1889-1893: already quoted, should recognise the fact that in some examples of
Years 1889-1893: already been drawn to the fact that recovery of pressure, after
Years 1889-1893: 4 Asa corollary to the fact already stated, that such bodies
Years 1889-1893: the fuller expression of ia fact that was already indicated by
Years 1889-1893: long been drawn to the fact that, whilst sandstone casts of
Years 1889-1893: must be drawn to the fact that higher numbers than those

Years 1889-1893: advert once more to the fact that the foregoing account is
Years 1889-1893: this will account for the fact that there is only a
Years 1889-1893: more. On account of the fact that no result among the
Years 1889-1893: principally on account of the fact that it -* be flayed
Years 1889-1893: a certain extent, The mere fact that the centripetal fibres which
Years 1889-1893: still further complicated by the fact that in certain species there
Years 1889-1893: suggestion must be placed the fact that in certain Physoclist fumilies
Years 1889-1893: of the posterior roots. This fact led us, at first, to
Years 1889-1893: no reason to doubt it—the fact just described would seem to
Years 1889-1893: roots, he clearly mentions the fact of the existence of isolated
Years 1889-1893: impossible not to recognise the fact so clearly illustrated by these
Years 1889-1893: evidently point clearly to the fact that the electrical change may
Years 1889-1893: clearly demonstrated by the significant fact that the presence of a
Years 1889-1893: the latter plants, beyond the fact that our fossil root most
Years 1889-1893: length of time, beyond the fact that it has always been
Years 1889-1893: influence of cold, placed this fact beyond doubt. As it is
Years 1889-1893: to these fibres, beyond the fact that such fibres come into
Years 1889-1893: place beyond all doubt the fact that the convoluted or vermiform
Years 1889-1893: is known beyond the bare fact that the bladder is more
Years 1889-1893: condition. In view of the fact that definite variations have been
Years 1889-1893: But in view of the fact that the Anomodontia was originally
Years 1889-1893: this view lies in the fact that excitation of one hemisphere
Years 1889-1893: ginger. In view of the fact that ordinary decoctions of ginger
Years 1889-1893: But in view of the fact that the yery existence of
Years 1889-1893: on any such basis, a fact the importance of which is
Years 1889-1893: feature of importance is the fact that, in the four independent
Years 1889-1893: is easily understood by a fact of some importance to our
Years 1889-1893: those of ammonia in the fact #hat.the convulsions never assume the
Years 1889-1893: no reason to doubt it—the fact just described would seem to
Years 1889-1893: no doubt due to the fact that the vaso-motor paralysis has
Years 1889-1893: place beyond all doubt the fact that the convoluted or vermiform
Years 1889-1893: injection, no doubt from the fact that the heart’s activity is
Years 1889-1893: merely to state the actual fact without involving any cause thereof;
Years 1889-1893: is sufficiently evident from the fact that it occurs less readily
Years 1889-1893: 11). This is the main fact to be noticed. The particular
Years 1889-1893: the main body from the fact that it is superior to
Years 1889-1893: other hanging on. Another peculiar fact noticed in connection with this
Years 1889-1893: the strength of the stimulus—a fact already noticed by ENGELMANN in
Years 1889-1893: these young branches. One special fact connected with an individual bundle
Years 1889-1893: and the Stigmarian roots. One fact more connected with this prosenchymatous
Years 1889-1893: roots, he clearly mentions the fact of the existence of isolated
Years 1889-1893: impossible not to recognise the fact so clearly illustrated by these
Years 1889-1893: evidently point clearly to the fact that the electrical change may
Years 1889-1893: clearly demonstrated by the significant fact that the presence of a
Years 1889-1893: simply consists in the obvious fact that removal of the cortex

Years 1889-1893: I have not mentioned the fact previously, but I now take
Years 1889-1893: stained or unstained. The first fact to be mentioned is that
Years 1889-1893: as is evidenced by the fact that we have been able

Years 1889-1893: in size, owing to the fact that it is here cut
Years 1889-1893: great interest, owing to the fact that it is always possible
Years 1889-1893: all these methods is the fact that, owing to the index

Years 1889-1893: Propyl Nitrite. The most obvious fact concerning primary propyl nitrite is
Years 1889-1893: due, in part, to the fact that it is extremely difficult
Years 1889-1893: one case, and with the fact that in the same skeleton

Years 1889-1893: is, however, one very important fact already referred to at the
Years 1889-1893: of respiration. This almost inexplicable fact was observed once, as seen
Years 1889-1893: Denératn calls attention to the fact that, according to the figures,
Years 1889-1893: according to him, by the fact that the cells give off
Years 1889-1893: conclusion is supported by the fact that a similar rise follows
Years 1889-1893: the Tables. (c.) The third fact which appears on comparing the
Years 1889-1893: of the diminishing wings. Another fact which appears to me to
Years 1889-1893: Rather more important is the fact that M. Renauur speaks of
