Years 1923-1927: of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed
Years 1923-1927: We have already mentioned the fact that the serum digested with
Years 1923-1927: mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by

Years 1923-1927: already been made of the fact that a pair of tube-feet
Years 1923-1927: is possibly due to the fact already mentioned, namely, that one

Years 1923-1927: chosen because they appear in fact to be associated with the
Years 1923-1927: the total meteorological phenomena in fact associated with rain, at the
Years 1923-1927: is vividly shown by the fact that two of the associated
Years 1923-1927: associated with the jaws. The fact that in Amia and Lepidosteus
Years 1923-1927: notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells,
Years 1923-1927: in sectioning. This and the fact that we have often found
Years 1923-1927: readily mistaken for them. The fact that they occur often in
Years 1923-1927: differentiation is given by the fact that the spindle fibre is

Years 1923-1927: matter from the eyes. In fact the water which is their
Years 1923-1927: frond is identical. The definite fact of attachment of a Telangium-like
Years 1923-1927: number that hatched, but the fact that so few survived must
Years 1923-1927: must be drawn to the fact that on many of the
Years 1923-1927: the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage
Years 1923-1927: period must be set the fact that in our diagrams the
Years 1923-1927: infinite : it must in fact be regarded as quite short.
Years 1923-1927: NESTA FERGUSON: THE ALOINA. the fact that each homologous pair must

Years 1923-1927: of the fin, and in fact a naked eye examination, shows

Years 1923-1927: might be expected from the fact that the degree of association
Years 1923-1927: their structure, and in the fact that their colour remains after
Years 1923-1927: rather thick, notwith- standing the fact that the colour disappears fairly
Years 1923-1927: it were not for the fact that the colour disappears with
Years 1923-1927: colour is due to the fact that the underlying tissues, which
Years 1923-1927: described, but, owing to the fact that the colour disappears or
Years 1923-1927: of the two species. This fact has proved of great importance
Years 1923-1927: the short hauls, and the fact that a great number of
Years 1923-1927: to bud. It is a fact of great interest that regeneration
Years 1923-1927: is reached. It is a fact of great interest that a
Years 1923-1927: lays great stress on the fact that the metapterygoid region of
Years 1923-1927: great difference lies in the fact that in the Sphenodon there
Years 1923-1927: reticulation is due to the fact that the scale is looped
Years 1923-1927: entirely rul.d out by the fact that the contingency tables show
Years 1923-1927: be due entirely to the fact that area 4 is bounded
Years 1923-1927: their diameter. Apart from the fact that many wing pigments can
Years 1923-1927: stronger than those reflected. The fact that many of these discussions
Years 1923-1927: must be drawn to the fact that on many of the
Years 1923-1927: of this region is the fact that many of the tributaries
Years 1923-1927: whole neural arch is in fact strikingly like that of the
Years 1923-1927: a pure spectrum-blue glass, a fact that has since been independently
Years 1923-1927: a character due to the fact that the curvature of the
Years 1923-1927: character in view of the fact that the sterile fronds are,
Years 1923-1927: cases if required, and in fact a certain number of details
Years 1923-1927: This was due to the fact that, while anthers in certain
Years 1923-1927: find in view of the fact that certain Miocene Suinie* possessed
Years 1923-1927: and sinuses, and also the fact that in a very complete
Years 1923-1927: is possibly supported by the fact that a complete two-way circulation
Years 1923-1927: seems to follow from the fact that the sitting boxes from
Years 1923-1927: germ-layer seems to establish the fact that the mitochondria shrink gradually

Years 1923-1927: although retia may, and in fact do, occur in both it
Years 1923-1927: the main rachis. Another important fact to notice is that there
Years 1923-1927: hy was calculated from the fact that when the difference between

Years 1923-1927: of the whole life-cycle, a fact VOL. CCXII.—B, R 120 MR.

Years 1923-1927: suffice to lay down the fact that only two species of

Years 1923-1927: by the IlI-group. Despite the fact that the two species are
