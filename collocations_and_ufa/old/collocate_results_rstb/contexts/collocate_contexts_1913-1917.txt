Years 1913-1917: taken. H6un1 considers that this fact points to “ the dependence

Years 1913-1917: was due solely to the fact that the female was not

Years 1913-1917: is apparently due to the fact that a number of lineages

Years 1913-1917: not been for the natural fact that the earliest mutations studied
Years 1913-1917: it we have disregarded the fact that the earliest sowings become
Years 1913-1917: old. This has established the fact that our laboratory conditions, after

Years 1913-1917: derived ; (8) in the fact that all the perihzemal pouches
Years 1913-1917: may be derived from the fact that the families with many
Years 1913-1917: is testified to by the fact already set forth that in
Years 1913-1917: involved. In view of the fact that the vertical distance between
Years 1913-1917: significant in view of the fact that he has an unusually
Years 1913-1917: view we take, the important fact remains that there is nothing
Years 1913-1917: and ovulate flowers : in fact a much wider view of
Years 1913-1917: and in view of this fact and of our present very
Years 1913-1917: and in view of the fact that two palobotanical horizons are
Years 1913-1917: view strongly supported by the fact that there are amongst them
Years 1913-1917: SOLUTIONS. In view of the fact that hypertonic sea-water and trivalent
Years 1913-1917: is based on the known fact that some oxidising ferments (e.g.
Years 1913-1917: Further difficulties arise from the fact that as the new fossil

Years 1913-1917: accurate, in spite of the fact that the total number recorded
Years 1913-1917: as the general conditions. This fact is, however, only recorded for
Years 1913-1917: view we take, the important fact remains that there is nothing
Years 1913-1917: cone as a whole. The fact remains that neither the cone

Years 1913-1917: floral shoots necessarily follow, the fact remains that these present a
Years 1913-1917: may be, there remains the fact that the flow of the
Years 1913-1917: Tt is not always the fact that all traces of this

Years 1913-1917: is little doubt from the fact that these forms can be
Years 1913-1917: be no doubt of the fact that these leaf-members are the
Years 1913-1917: no doubt due to the fact that at times he got
Years 1913-1917: the former case to the fact that two lateral stamen-primordia were
Years 1913-1917: a Cladoceran, owing to the fact that the former grows continuously,
Years 1913-1917: amplitude, which accords with the fact that the subject (a telegrapher)
Years 1913-1917: ago called attention to the fact that the true posterior end
Years 1913-1917: might be explained by the fact that under certain conditions the
Years 1913-1917: to show this, and the fact that the local endemics increase
Years 1913-1917: alone. He also elicited the fact that no increase in the
Years 1913-1917: factor brings out the curious fact that this effect of cold
Years 1913-1917: factor in (7) and the fact that it involves @ and
Years 1913-1917: the last embryo in the fact that the ventral solid portion
Years 1913-1917: This is due to the fact that, although the entire hind-limb
Years 1913-1917: to be sought in the fact that, although the Wyre Forest
Years 1913-1917: however, is determined by the fact that they are clearly overlain
Years 1913-1917: we could obtain. The one fact which does stand out clearly
Years 1913-1917: is clearly the expression of fact that the floral axis is
Years 1913-1917: the excitation current first. This fact is clearly shown by Table
Years 1913-1917: Callixylon approaches Archwopitys in the fact that most of the primary
Years 1913-1917: their first flower- buds. This fact is of primary importance in
Years 1913-1917: arises here, owing to the fact that in normal animals the
Years 1913-1917: cannot be responsible for the fact that the normal amount of
Years 1913-1917: is due firstly to the fact that the normal level of
Years 1913-1917: was based upon (1) the fact that the normal outline of
Years 1913-1917: receives considerable support from the fact that the elimination of chromosomes
Years 1913-1917: these studies brought out a fact of very considerable importance. Taste
Years 1913-1917: allowance is made for this fact and the somewhat greater margin
Years 1913-1917: make this point clear. The fact that the branch of Q
Years 1913-1917: * Being in point of fact the longest node charted in
Years 1913-1917: is transected. In point of fact they do not rise (Table

Years 1913-1917: other young mammals ; in fact the whole structure seems to
Years 1913-1917: Further, in correlation with the fact that the young is now
Years 1913-1917: the model, owing to the fact that the extremely young procartilaginous
Years 1913-1917: Further difficulties arise from the fact that as the new fossil

Years 1913-1917: other young mammals ; in fact the whole structure seems to
Years 1913-1917: prevomers of a lizard. This fact seems to demonstrate the strict
Years 1913-1917: revealed to us the astonishing fact that the whole shell wall
Years 1913-1917: other young mammals ; in fact the whole structure seems to
Years 1913-1917: to be explained by the fact that the whole free wall
Years 1913-1917: has drawn attention to this fact with regard to the inheritance
Years 1913-1917: regard being had to the fact that to arrive at any
Years 1913-1917: In this way the well-known fact of transpiration in saturated air
Years 1913-1917: in the adult guinea-pig, a fact easy to verify and already
Years 1913-1917: already been made of the fact that there is only one
Years 1913-1917: is testified to by the fact already set forth that in

Years 1913-1917: below the transverse part. In fact where two spools come fairly
Years 1913-1917: the histology lies in the fact that between the two regions
Years 1913-1917: the former case to the fact that two lateral stamen-primordia were
Years 1913-1917: the two coalfields is in fact continuous near Bridgnorth, where, however,
Years 1913-1917: and in view of the fact that two palobotanical horizons are
Years 1913-1917: this is provided by the fact that two lines were bred
Years 1913-1917: was unnecessary owing to the fact that the two lines of
Years 1913-1917: in the laboratory, and the fact that the two forms are
Years 1913-1917: This is supported by the fact that hybrids between these two
Years 1913-1917: one is confronted with the fact that of two groups of
Years 1913-1917: Against Hrserpen’s method was the fact that no two thermometers are
Years 1913-1917: inevitable that it is the fact of causing the one central
Years 1913-1917: and possibly also to the fact that the central representation must
Years 1913-1917: after its removal. Also the fact that the central end of
Years 1913-1917: should be laid upon the fact that neither in ourselves nor
Years 1913-1917: ENAMEL AND DENTINE. 107 This fact has an important bearing upon
Years 1913-1917: 4, and I think this fact has a strong bearing upon
Years 1913-1917: was based upon (1) the fact that the normal outline of
Years 1913-1917: capillaries, we may mention the fact that it seemed to us
Years 1913-1917: maintaining its conducting power. This fact may be demonstrated in the
Years 1913-1917: 5:9 | 2°5 8:3 The fact that stimulus itself may enhance
Years 1913-1917: may be found in the fact that an error was made
Years 1913-1917: may be due to the fact that the Tomes’ processes are
Years 1913-1917: may be compared with the fact that in 1912 most of
Years 1913-1917: may be derived from the fact that the families with many
Years 1913-1917: may call attention to the fact that (though this species is
Years 1913-1917: may be illustrated by the fact that we regularly employed a
Years 1913-1917: 200 miles an hour. This fact may prove of some consolation
Years 1913-1917: may be, there remains the fact that the flow of the
Years 1913-1917: IV are constantly present. The fact that thymus IV may occur
Years 1913-1917: development in the stem, a fact possibly associated with the persistent
Years 1913-1917: make this point clear. The fact that the branch of Q
