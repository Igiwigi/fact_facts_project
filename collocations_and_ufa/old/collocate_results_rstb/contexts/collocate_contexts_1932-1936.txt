Years 1932-1936: and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has
Years 1932-1936: must have been young. This fact is significant, for the results
Years 1932-1936: must be inferred from the fact that the denervated skin is

Years 1932-1936: must be made for the fact that the older leaves had
