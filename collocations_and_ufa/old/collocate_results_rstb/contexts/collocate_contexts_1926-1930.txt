Years 1926-1930: This, in connection with the fact that none of the later
Years 1926-1930: is vividly shown by the fact that two of the associated
Years 1926-1930: two very different values, a fact which is shown also by
Years 1926-1930: importance is shown by the fact that these ciliated tracts are
Years 1926-1930: Ficaria verna, however, reveal the fact that, as shown by the
Years 1926-1930: relation is shown by the fact that the continuity is present
Years 1926-1930: pyramid is shown by the fact that the derivatives of these
Years 1926-1930: it receives support from the fact that this division of the
Years 1926-1930: division was 0-8 wu. This fact was also clearly brought out
Years 1926-1930: the death of these, a fact which had long been suspected.

Years 1926-1930: system and the lymphatics. The fact that the connections in the
Years 1926-1930: system is indicated by the fact that they do contain blood,
Years 1926-1930: labyrinth would also explain the fact that a portion of the
Years 1926-1930: configuration would result. In actual fact there are no indications whatever
Years 1926-1930: interesting intermediate condition in the fact that the upper edge of

Years 1926-1930: case is analogous to the fact that xerophytes in general tend
Years 1926-1930: two specimens lies in the fact that in the one case
Years 1926-1930: differentiation is given by the fact that the spindle fibre is
Years 1926-1930: the mitochondrial cloud, and the fact that there are much fewer
Years 1926-1930: a primitive feature,* and the fact that it is much less
Years 1926-1930: mammals have been derived. In fact this new type is much
Years 1926-1930: much reduced owing to the fact that the ball portion of
Years 1926-1930: is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the
Years 1926-1930: is probably due to the fact that the cambium is active
Years 1926-1930: is probably introduced by the fact that the two leaves at
Years 1926-1930: outside the ectodermal teloblasts, a fact probably correlated with the late
Years 1926-1930: at temperatures below 11-12°C. This fact probably accounts for the failure

Years 1926-1930: one is struck by the fact that as the larger vessels
