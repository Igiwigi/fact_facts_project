Years 1921-1925: these wings, owing to the fact that by transmitted light they

Years 1921-1925: conclusion is based upon the fact that the Vertebrate is essentially
Years 1921-1925: can be based on the fact that we have no knowledge
Years 1921-1925: can be based on the fact that we have no experience
Years 1921-1925: method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed
Years 1921-1925: quotient is due to the fact that the CO, output is
Years 1921-1925: at least, due to the fact that the energy output during
Years 1921-1925: diminution is due to the fact that when rest is resumed
Years 1921-1925: very nearly erect ; this fact may quite possibly be due
Years 1921-1925: a character due to the fact that the curvature of the
Years 1921-1925: was probably due to the fact that Carrr, MACALISTER and Dwiaeut,
Years 1921-1925: is generally due to the fact that the scales are not
Years 1921-1925: reticulation is due to the fact that the scale is looped
Years 1921-1925: colour is due to the fact that the underlying tissues, which
Years 1921-1925: it is due to the fact that the conditions of respiration
Years 1921-1925: supervenes is due to the fact that there is not only
Years 1921-1925: this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations
Years 1921-1925: due no doubt to the fact that the two sets of
Years 1921-1925: ends irregularly due to the fact that it becomes increasingly thinner
Years 1921-1925: measurements, is indicated by the fact that on the morning after
Years 1921-1925: Sagenopteris is indicated by the fact that some earlier authors placed
Years 1921-1925: these relations lying in the fact that the adjacent cell on
Years 1921-1925: this period, allowing for the fact that adjacent points are not
Years 1921-1925: support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,

Years 1921-1925: Research, Most striking is the fact that in all three types
Years 1921-1925: the Hercynian movements. When that fact is allowed for, a striking
Years 1921-1925: support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,
Years 1921-1925: receives some support from the fact that the two independent values
Years 1921-1925: however, is evident from the fact that, in caudal vertebrie of

Years 1921-1925: explanation is found for the fact that, at high altitudes, the
Years 1921-1925: The true explanation of this fact will likely be found in
Years 1921-1925: a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of
Years 1921-1925: principal drawback lies in the fact that during exercise the subject

Years 1921-1925: particular interest to recall the fact that in Somniosus rostratus the
Years 1921-1925: high correlations lies in the fact that the particular variates chosen
Years 1921-1925: 51° W., both from the fact that the previous minimum record
Years 1921-1925: posterior), and to record the fact that Sphenodon is similar to
Years 1921-1925: recovery is connected with the fact that the anterior part of
Years 1921-1925: some way connected with the fact that the summer of 1920

Years 1921-1925: and, in view of the fact that many “pure-cultures” of fungi
Years 1921-1925: pigment. In view of the fact that the new character is
Years 1921-1925: (Plate 9, fig. 2), a fact which supports Van TreGuem’s view
Years 1921-1925: of this view is the fact that when, as in the
Years 1921-1925: of the view is the fact that in some Batoids there

Years 1921-1925: leaves of Cordaites, and in fact the leaves of any known
Years 1921-1925: It is a well known fact that certain varieties of potato
Years 1921-1925: lie along the divides. The fact that the Irish eskers are
Years 1921-1925: upper, therein agreeing with the fact that the percentage hatched in
Years 1921-1925: and, in view of the fact that many “pure-cultures” of fungi
Years 1921-1925: their diameter. Apart from the fact that many wing pigments can

Years 1921-1925: must be drawn to the fact that on many of the
Years 1921-1925: of this region is the fact that many of the tributaries

Years 1921-1925: dealt with here. The significant fact is, that important changes have
Years 1921-1925: of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed
Years 1921-1925: thing is shown by the fact that the total heat production
Years 1921-1925: inorganic, as shown by the fact that in some layers they

Years 1921-1925: appearance. In our own cases—a fact observed by most previous workers
Years 1921-1925: 27, p. 880). But the fact that the calcified rays of
Years 1921-1925: are unealcified, and from the fact that the calcified tesserse of
Years 1921-1925: have calcified tesserse, and the fact that these are better developed

Years 1921-1925: their structure, and in the fact that their colour remains after
Years 1921-1925: rather thick, notwith- standing the fact that the colour disappears fairly

Years 1921-1925: is reached. It is a fact of great interest that a

Years 1921-1925: number that hatched, but the fact that so few survived must
Years 1921-1925: must be drawn to the fact that on many of the
Years 1921-1925: the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage
