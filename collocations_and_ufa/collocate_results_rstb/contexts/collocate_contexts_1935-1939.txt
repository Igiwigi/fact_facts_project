Years 1935-1939: features, the first being the fact that whereas the male has
Years 1935-1939: difference, however, lies in the fact that whereas in Carausius the
Years 1935-1939: class is the repeatedly observed fact that whereas paracrinkle virus carried
Years 1935-1939: even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules

Years 1935-1939: hind-gut, so that the mere fact of a given region exhibiting

Years 1935-1939: preserved, probably account for the fact that the Acanthodians are now
Years 1935-1939: earlier on account of the fact that at some localities at
Years 1935-1939: Pleistocene on account of the fact that Levallois artifacts having a

Years 1935-1939: soufriéres. Seismo-volcanic phenomena were in fact largely ignored until 1902. To
Years 1935-1939: selection is demonstrated by the fact that while over 50°%, of
Years 1935-1939: whole was demonstrated by the fact that the distance between the
Years 1935-1939: crown of the tooth, in fact it is recogniz- able before

Years 1935-1939: on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,
Years 1935-1939: feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of
Years 1935-1939: of this group is the fact that practically the whole area

Years 1935-1939: whole was demonstrated by the fact that the distance between the

Years 1935-1939: Salt (1937) states that the fact that Trichogramma will reject true
Years 1935-1939: class is the repeatedly observed fact that whereas paracrinkle virus carried

Years 1935-1939: above the present lake. This fact together with its generally denuded
Years 1935-1939: growth was shown by the fact that the distance between their
Years 1935-1939: whole was demonstrated by the fact that the distance between the
Years 1935-1939: is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is

Years 1935-1939: This is disproved by the fact that it appears in vitro
Years 1935-1939: was made possible by the fact that many plants from the
Years 1935-1939: parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the

Years 1935-1939: mesenteries of connective tissue. This fact has considerable significance, since it
Years 1935-1939: considerable length of time. This fact also applies for the pennate
Years 1935-1939: of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens
Years 1935-1939: extrusion of the latter. This fact seems to indicate a considerable
Years 1935-1939: may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a
Years 1935-1939: pharynx is associated with the fact that the function of the
