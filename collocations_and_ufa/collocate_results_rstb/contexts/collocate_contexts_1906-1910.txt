Years 1906-1910: the foregoing calculations. Firstly, the fact that the amount of flow
Years 1906-1910: actual amount, and, secondly, the fact that the amount of flow
Years 1906-1910: is possibly owing to the fact that the rate of flow
Years 1906-1910: filled with water. (4) The fact that the flow of water
Years 1906-1910: were at work. (5) The fact that, ceteris paribus, the flow
Years 1906-1910: high resistance to flow. The fact that even then the flow
Years 1906-1910: The same applies to the fact that flow is possible down
Years 1906-1910: it is due to the fact that a rapid flow is
Years 1906-1910: flow is due to the fact that: (1) the vessels, as
Years 1906-1910: have another illustration of the fact that primitive characters which were

Years 1906-1910: primitive seed-bearing plants. Beyond the fact that in Gnetum the oospore

Years 1906-1910: stem is due to the fact that the water enters the

Years 1906-1910: argument may be urged the fact that concretions are typically spherical
Years 1906-1910: it is probable that this fact may explain how, in hemiplegia

Years 1906-1910: completely filled with water. The fact that the water disappears first

Years 1906-1910: a primitive knot was in fact present at some distance from
Years 1906-1910: the present study is the fact that the xylem of the
Years 1906-1910: stem is due to the fact that the water enters the
