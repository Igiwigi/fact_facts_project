Years 1908-1912: Vincentt lays stress upon the fact that the two structures are
Years 1908-1912: still more complex by the fact that each of the two

Years 1908-1912: the two consists in the fact that in the lateral eye

Years 1908-1912: the Sub-Crag industry, and in fact one which establishes it as
Years 1908-1912: of the higher Angiosperms. The fact that the number of constituents

Years 1908-1912: argument may be urged the fact that concretions are typically spherical
Years 1908-1912: it is probable that this fact may explain how, in hemiplegia
