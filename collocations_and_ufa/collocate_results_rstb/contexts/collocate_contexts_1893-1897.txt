Years 1893-1897: In the first place, the fact is of much interest that

Years 1893-1897: deflection, is indicated by the fact that a similar diminution can

Years 1893-1897: two or three days. This fact is quit sufficient to account
Years 1893-1897: receives some support from the fact that in the allied genus
Years 1893-1897: Sphenophyllum, in which genus the fact of superposition is well established

Years 1893-1897: as is shown by the fact transverse sections we may find
Years 1893-1897: is further indicated by the fact that, in transverse sections, a
Years 1893-1897: second alternative lies in the fact that, while it may prove
Years 1893-1897: The increase is a ing fact from the second to the
Years 1893-1897: of muscle.* The second noteworthy fact is involved in that just
Years 1893-1897: its minute structure is the fact that this tissue passes over
Years 1893-1897: to be sought in the fact that the remarkable structure in

Years 1893-1897: coat of coral, The ehief fact is that the wall of

Years 1893-1897: conclusions founded upon them. The fact that glycogen is formed, not

Years 1893-1897: of Turbinaria, is in the fact that a number of the
Years 1893-1897: fructifications of the family.§ The fact that the number of members

Years 1893-1897: worth repeating here the familiar fact that costee are present in
Years 1893-1897: fossula is present. The chief fact which at present calls our
Years 1893-1897: position of research. The very fact that the Eupsammide at present
