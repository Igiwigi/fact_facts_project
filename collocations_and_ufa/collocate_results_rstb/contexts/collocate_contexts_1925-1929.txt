Years 1925-1929: but be surprised at the fact that a mammal so interesting

Years 1925-1929: can be based on the fact that we have no knowledge
Years 1925-1929: can be based on the fact that we have no experience
Years 1925-1929: method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed
Years 1925-1929: conclusion is based on the fact that in the exposure farthest
Years 1925-1929: exceptionally rich in glycogen, a fact which has been recorded by
Years 1925-1929: can be based on the fact that we have no knowledge
Years 1925-1929: ; in view of the fact that our knowledge of the
Years 1925-1929: is clearly correlated with the fact that in the Lamellibranchs alone
Years 1925-1929: outside the ectodermal teloblasts, a fact probably correlated with the late
Years 1925-1929: could be correlated with the fact that the monotremes use their
Years 1925-1929: intensive study. Without doubt, this fact may be correlated with the
Years 1925-1929: between the ridges; secondly, the fact that the ovules were borne
Years 1925-1929: is borne out by the fact that in earlier experiments with
Years 1925-1929: identical. As a matter of fact the winter dip is slightly
Years 1925-1929: IV). As a matter of fact the number of genera with

Years 1925-1929: difficulty is increased by the fact that the roof of the
Years 1925-1929: resemblance is increased by the fact that in some lizards according
Years 1925-1929: is to be added the fact that errors of sampling in
Years 1925-1929: the lymphatics, added to the fact that no connection could be

Years 1925-1929: This, in connection with the fact that none of the later

Years 1925-1929: of GEGENBAUR recording the remarkable fact that during the 7th and
Years 1925-1929: a later stage. Another remarkable fact is the extremely small angle
Years 1925-1929: is suggested also by the fact that in the Cod, in
Years 1925-1929: is suggested (1) by the fact that Favaro (7) figures in
Years 1925-1929: I think, suggested by the fact that in Lophius in which

Years 1925-1929: a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of
Years 1925-1929: mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by
Years 1925-1929: in the theory, which in fact has been already advanced to
Years 1925-1929: already been made of the fact that a pair of tube-feet
Years 1925-1929: is possibly due to the fact already mentioned, namely, that one
Years 1925-1929: others have already observed this fact correctly, but are, I venture
Years 1925-1929: receives some support from the fact that the two independent values
Years 1925-1929: it receives support from the fact that this division of the
Years 1925-1929: of superimposed nerve fibres. This fact lends additional support to the
Years 1925-1929: examples of modern Angiosperms. This fact lends support to the view
Years 1925-1929: view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon granules could

Years 1925-1929: to this view is the fact that, while the latter are

Years 1925-1929: view is supported by the fact that this part of the
Years 1925-1929: Further, in view of the fact that in Amia, Lepidosteus, and

Years 1925-1929: of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed
Years 1925-1929: the Hercynian movements. When that fact is allowed for, a striking
Years 1925-1929: attention was drawn to this fact and to the striking degree
Years 1925-1929: F,. The most ia striking fact concerning these triple hybrids is
Years 1925-1929: is certainly due to the fact that the eye is shut
Years 1925-1929: the main rachis. Another important fact to notice is that there
Years 1925-1929: is not preserved. An important fact is the difference in the
Years 1925-1929: The significance of this important fact will be discussed later. The
Years 1925-1929: follows at once from the fact that the distri- bution of
Years 1925-1929: It naturally follows from the fact that the growth of a

Years 1925-1929: of the endoskeletal system. The fact just mentioned that the valve

Years 1925-1929: is vividly shown by the fact that two of the associated
Years 1925-1929: two very different values, a fact which is shown also by
Years 1925-1929: importance is shown by the fact that these ciliated tracts are
Years 1925-1929: Ficaria verna, however, reveal the fact that, as shown by the
Years 1925-1929: relation is shown by the fact that the continuity is present
Years 1925-1929: before our eyes. Further, the fact that a new development of
Years 1925-1929: ; and by the second fact that mortality in the two
Years 1925-1929: dominant, and also the second fact that the Equisetales and Cordaitales
Years 1925-1929: to explain it by the fact that the egg trays were
Years 1925-1929: through the literature revealed the fact that although isolated observations existed,
Years 1925-1929: labyrinth would also explain the fact that a portion of the
Years 1925-1929: ; but, apart from the fact that the whole calculation is
Years 1925-1929: whole neural arch is in fact strikingly like that of the
Years 1925-1929: This is owing to the fact that, in whole mounts, the
Years 1925-1929: cases if required, and in fact a certain number of details
Years 1925-1929: This was due to the fact that, while anthers in certain
Years 1925-1929: find in view of the fact that certain Miocene Suinie* possessed
Years 1925-1929: regarded as true air-breathers. The fact that certain fish, such as
Years 1925-1929: the lymphatics, added to the fact that no connection could be
Years 1925-1929: This, in connection with the fact that none of the later
Years 1925-1929: the lymphatics, added to the fact that no connection could be
Years 1925-1929: This, in connection with the fact that none of the later

Years 1925-1929: long plumose sete, retaining in fact almost exactly the general form
Years 1925-1929: This is due to the fact that in the case of
Years 1925-1929: the skull. This is in fact the case in all Embolomeri,
Years 1925-1929: case is analogous to the fact that xerophytes in general tend
Years 1925-1929: system and the lymphatics. The fact that the connections in the
Years 1925-1929: system is indicated by the fact that they do contain blood,
Years 1925-1929: differentiation is given by the fact that the spindle fibre is
Years 1925-1929: perception of red, by the fact that the fish were more
Years 1925-1929: the mitochondrial cloud, and the fact that there are much fewer
Years 1925-1929: a primitive feature,* and the fact that it is much less
Years 1925-1929: of A is probably the fact that the eggs in the
Years 1925-1929: is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the
Years 1925-1929: is probably due to the fact that the cambium is active
Years 1925-1929: is probably introduced by the fact that the two leaves at
Years 1925-1929: outside the ectodermal teloblasts, a fact probably correlated with the late
Years 1925-1929: » dimensions ; using this fact it may be shown without
Years 1925-1929: out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be
Years 1925-1929: may be due to the fact that segmental excretory organs are
Years 1925-1929: be recalled, and the further fact may be instanced that, though
Years 1925-1929: may ultimately be explained, the fact has a distinct bearing on
Years 1925-1929: inferior jugular of Lopholatilus. The fact that it may open into
Years 1925-1929: to be required by the fact that responses may be obtained
Years 1925-1929: intensive study. Without doubt, this fact may be correlated with the
Years 1925-1929: long plumose sete, retaining in fact almost exactly the general form
Years 1925-1929: this in spite of the fact that ground- up shells form
Years 1925-1929: by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that the phenomena of invasion
Years 1925-1929: ; and by the second fact that mortality in the two
Years 1925-1929: due no doubt to the fact that the two sets of
Years 1925-1929: receives some support from the fact that the two independent values

Years 1925-1929: two of the projections. The fact that the primordia of these
Years 1925-1929: is vividly shown by the fact that two of the associated
Years 1925-1929: the latter two groups. The fact that Polypterus, whith has nothing
Years 1925-1929: two very different values, a fact which is shown also by
Years 1925-1929: is probably introduced by the fact that the two leaves at
Years 1925-1929: interesting intermediate condition in the fact that the upper edge of
Years 1925-1929: with S. Hirikiana and the fact that similar leaves are attached
Years 1925-1929: are similar but for the fact that the overlap of the

Years 1925-1929: extraordinarily close. It is in fact better than one has any

Years 1925-1929: number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots
