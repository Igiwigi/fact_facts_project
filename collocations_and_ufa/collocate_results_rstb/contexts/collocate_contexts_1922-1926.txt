Years 1922-1926: it is due to the fact that the conditions of respiration
Years 1922-1926: supervenes is due to the fact that there is not only
Years 1922-1926: this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations
Years 1922-1926: due no doubt to the fact that the two sets of

Years 1922-1926: may be due to the fact that segmental excretory organs are
Years 1922-1926: pro- bably due to the fact that they were more strongly

Years 1922-1926: This is due to the fact that the plates through which

Years 1922-1926: no doubt arises from the fact that food substances are continually
Years 1922-1926: support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,
Years 1922-1926: receives some support from the fact that the two independent values

Years 1922-1926: to this view is the fact that, while the latter are

Years 1922-1926: view is supported by the fact that this part of the

Years 1922-1926: unable to deduce from this fact the presence of pectic substances,
Years 1922-1926: recovery is connected with the fact that the anterior part of
Years 1922-1926: some way connected with the fact that the summer of 1920

Years 1922-1926: notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells,
Years 1922-1926: in sectioning. This and the fact that we have often found
Years 1922-1926: readily mistaken for them. The fact that they occur often in

Years 1922-1926: against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before
