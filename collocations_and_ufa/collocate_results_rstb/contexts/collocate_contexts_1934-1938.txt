Years 1934-1938: Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development
Years 1934-1938: of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens
Years 1934-1938: constant feature, and mentioned this fact to Professor Exnttor Smrra (see

Years 1934-1938: connexion, fig. 9, and the fact that the orbital artery runs
Years 1934-1938: be well to stress the fact that they represent dioptrographic projections,
Years 1934-1938: Thus, should that phenomenon in fact represent a secondary growth, it
Years 1934-1938: nodules of later stages, in fact represent the mesodermal contents of

Years 1934-1938: it is evident from the fact that some portions of them
Years 1934-1938: to describe the condition, the fact remains that in this early
Years 1934-1938: O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains that it has survived
Years 1934-1938: sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus

Years 1934-1938: this interpretation as conclusive. In fact glands having this mixed condition
Years 1934-1938: a mechanical interpretation concerns the fact that in the preceding experiments
Years 1934-1938: is important to notice the fact that the pila antotica (p.a.)
Years 1934-1938: even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules
Years 1934-1938: migration and to the important fact that in adult insects there
Years 1934-1938: this was due to the fact that the older leaves covered

Years 1934-1938: This was based upon the fact that in the forms which
Years 1934-1938: therefore only due to the fact that it was based on
Years 1934-1938: growth and differentiation. The second fact of importance from the point
Years 1934-1938: Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development
Years 1934-1938: of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens
Years 1934-1938: diverticulum (dc.). Owing to the fact that the diverticulum passes to
Years 1934-1938: upon nothing more than the fact that the diverticulum develops as
Years 1934-1938: far along this path. One fact we may, however, notice at
Years 1934-1938: in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently overlooked that
Years 1934-1938: the vena hyoidea. (10) The fact that the palato-quadrates as far
Years 1934-1938: at Comley, together with the fact that the Lapworthella Limestone is
Years 1934-1938: This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development
Years 1934-1938: described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very
Years 1934-1938: all tubercles. It is a fact of considerable interest that the
Years 1934-1938: of some interest is the fact (reported later, p. 433) that
Years 1934-1938: interest in view of the fact that some authors have suggested
Years 1934-1938: Of special interest is the fact that any sideward lean of
Years 1934-1938: would seem, resides in the fact that the colour changing reptiles
Years 1934-1938: the chameleon. The most generalized fact about colour response in amphibia,
Years 1934-1938: has been drawn to the fact that these cords are to
Years 1934-1938: conclusion is drawn from the fact that the part of the
Years 1934-1938: full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at
Years 1934-1938: class is the repeatedly observed fact that whereas paracrinkle virus carried
Years 1934-1938: their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly
Years 1934-1938: has established beyond question the fact that the chromatophores of the
Years 1934-1938: question is complicated by the fact that in the mammal, the
Years 1934-1938: that of H. wrighti. This fact seems to support the suggestion
Years 1934-1938: a pyramid is not. This fact gives strong support to the
Years 1934-1938: support of this is the fact that it is additional to
Years 1934-1938: in some way with the fact that the testes are abdominal
Years 1934-1938: in any way elongated, in fact rather contracted, so that the
Years 1934-1938: have already referred to the fact that the region behind the

Years 1934-1938: 433) has already recorded the fact that this specimen proves the

Years 1934-1938: more or less together, a fact already apparent from the stratigraphy.
Years 1934-1938: already indicated, it is this fact which appears to be responsible
Years 1934-1938: already been made to the fact that during the season 1937

Years 1934-1938: and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a
Years 1934-1938: may be found in the fact that the former are more
Years 1934-1938: interest in view of the fact that some authors have suggested
Years 1934-1938: base this view on the fact that Srensio’s suggested restoration of
Years 1934-1938: weakness is suggested by the fact that Gage’s Lower, Spring Ghaut,
Years 1934-1938: on the available data this fact must be regarded as an
Years 1934-1938: vegetative cells were found. This fact shows that resting spores, provided

Years 1934-1938: may be associated with the fact that the syrinx has superseded
Years 1934-1938: may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a
Years 1934-1938: pharynx is associated with the fact that the function of the
Years 1934-1938: must be made for the fact that the older leaves had
Years 1934-1938: has been made of this fact in linkage studies, for which
Years 1934-1938: is made improbable by the fact that, although hernia is very

Years 1934-1938: already been made to the fact that the greater part of
Years 1934-1938: made in view of the fact that, although no direct evidence
Years 1934-1938: should be made with this fact in mind, and not merely
Years 1934-1938: already been made to the fact that during the season 1937
Years 1934-1938: disease investigation have emphasized the fact that the peculiar protein body

Years 1934-1938: considerable length of time. This fact also applies for the pennate
Years 1934-1938: of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens
Years 1934-1938: features. There is first the fact of the wide tubes, in
