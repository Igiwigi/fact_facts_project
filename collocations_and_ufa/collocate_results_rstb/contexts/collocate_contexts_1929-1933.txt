Years 1929-1933: as is shown by the fact that in the great majority

Years 1929-1933: and equally remarkable is the fact that the part of the
Years 1929-1933: part at least, to fhe fact that the uterine wall around
Years 1929-1933: the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in
Years 1929-1933: be contended, however, that the fact of one animal receiving its

Years 1929-1933: two specimens lies in the fact that in the one case
Years 1929-1933: should be exact, but the fact remains that one of them
Years 1929-1933: of one. How- ever, the fact that there is only one
Years 1929-1933: (“ hyo-pré-glottique ”), and the fact that he described only one
Years 1929-1933: proven true, a very suggestive fact for the phylogenetic development of
Years 1929-1933: before our eyes. Further, the fact that a new development of
Years 1929-1933: dorsal lip, and by the fact that the development of both
Years 1929-1933: is clearly indicated by the fact that the degree of development
Years 1929-1933: posterior endoderm rudiment arises later—in fact its development coincides with the
Years 1929-1933: perature. Further evidence of this fact is given by the development
Years 1929-1933: two specimens lies in the fact that in the one case
Years 1929-1933: two rudiments and secondly the fact that the “ Kérper- knorpel”

Years 1929-1933: less than twenty-five minutes. The fact that it required about two
Years 1929-1933: any other genus, by the fact that it and two other
Years 1929-1933: small or large, is a fact needing explanation. There are two
Years 1929-1933: the two lower molars in fact helps to show that there
Years 1929-1933: two primordia on each side—a fact of which the explanation will
Years 1929-1933: explanation is supported by the fact that in the two experiments

Years 1929-1933: the anterior paraseptal cartilage, which fact raises doubts as to whether
