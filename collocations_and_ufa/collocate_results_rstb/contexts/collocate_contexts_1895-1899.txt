Years 1895-1899: lays great stress upon the fact that the increase in size

Years 1895-1899: con- siderably. In practice the fact is of no great importance,
Years 1895-1899: of microbes is an important fact to be observed in the
Years 1895-1899: themselves, but indicating merely the fact observed that the calcareous fibres,
Years 1895-1899: a little greater. One curious fact observed was that with strong
Years 1895-1899: ingeniously makes use of the fact in his discussion on Desmodium
Years 1895-1899: use of acid media. The fact was also interesting that it
Years 1895-1899: stand out as a curious fact without any immediate and simple
Years 1895-1899: action on the heart. The fact is not without importance as
Years 1895-1899: may be connected with the fact that in Ephedra the segmentation

Years 1895-1899: difference however consists in the fact that a trabecular axis never
Years 1895-1899: shortness, is, I believe, the fact that they never developed in
Years 1895-1899: This will account for the fact that, whereas Gourz’s dog could
Years 1895-1899: two or three days. This fact is quit sufficient to account
Years 1895-1899: may perhaps account for the fact that Pelvetia refuses to grow
Years 1895-1899: of the calyx follows in fact the same system throughout, and
Years 1895-1899: lower limb. From the latter fact it follows that the path

Years 1895-1899: really inulin, follows from the fact that both the sections of

Years 1895-1899: the cat, owing to the fact that the movements of the

Years 1895-1899: plants is shown by the fact that, according to Swinaxx,t the
Years 1895-1899: possess their main features. This fact is brought out plainly in
Years 1895-1899: the case of Danea. In fact all the main features are
Years 1895-1899: of later authors, but the fact that’ the term EVOLUTION OF
Years 1895-1899: left an open question. The fact that the exceptional result may

Years 1895-1899: and to point out the fact that the results arrived at

Years 1895-1899: body was assumed from the fact that no evidence of their
Years 1895-1899: than vegetative leaves. An important fact remains which disposes of the
Years 1895-1899: is proved — by the fact that we often find bundles
Years 1895-1899: ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND the fact that it became often fixed
Years 1895-1899: also in view of a fact I Ehave often seen, that
Years 1895-1899: is made clear by the fact that lateral section of the
Years 1895-1899: We therefore observe the striking fact that whilst in the summer

Years 1895-1899: would draw attention to the fact that the latter saw those
Years 1895-1899: would favour the view. The fact remains, however, that a descending
Years 1895-1899: would draw attention to the fact that Soporra, in his admirable
Years 1895-1899: would lay stress on the fact that certain types are not
Years 1895-1899: would be checked by the fact that fertilisation and the development
Years 1895-1899: doubtless a stomatal effect. This fact would probably have been demonstrated

Years 1895-1899: two peripheral ends, is the fact that the end with the

Years 1895-1899: from both ends, from the fact that both central and peripheral

Years 1895-1899: the isobutyl compound. Bhis latter fact may be further illustrated by
Years 1895-1899: may be judged by the fact that the reported fertility of
Years 1895-1899: and monkey, lies in the fact that they both may menstruate
Years 1895-1899: in direct opposition to the fact that menstruation may oceur after
Years 1895-1899: may be now added the fact that the effect is produced

Years 1895-1899: is associated with the general fact that the basal body-wall in

Years 1895-1899: still more heightened by the fact that the individual pali appear
Years 1895-1899: types among the Poritide. One fact still deserves to be mentioned
Years 1895-1899: still more striking by the fact that in moving forward the
Years 1895-1899: of the sorus; but this fact is still more apparent in
Years 1895-1899: pericycle. Direct proof of this fact is afforded by a still

Years 1895-1899: segments composing the sag in fact they are only very slightly

Years 1895-1899: had laid stress upon the fact that the whole neurapophysis consists
Years 1895-1899: sufficient stress upon the undoubted fact that a portion of organ

Years 1895-1899: considerable number of times.* This fact has become familiar to us,as
Years 1895-1899: of Turbinaria, is in the fact that a number of the
Years 1895-1899: fructifications of the family.§ The fact that the number of members
Years 1895-1899: are more than eight, in fact the number seems to be
Years 1895-1899: Sphenophyllum, in which genus the fact of superposition is well established
Years 1895-1899: each case was microspheric. The fact that the whole of the

Years 1895-1899: case of vegetative buds, a fact of possible cytological interest may
Years 1895-1899: may be now added the fact that the effect is produced

Years 1895-1899: leaf could be established, the fact would be of the greatest
Years 1895-1899: leaf » shut. S The fact that red is more efficacious
Years 1895-1899: leaf closes the stomata, the fact proves clearly that Bihe epidermic
Years 1895-1899: poison is shown by the fact that the perfusion of this

Years 1895-1899: wings is shown by the fact that in a series of
Years 1895-1899: the figures above cited). This fact is shown with special beauty
Years 1895-1899: adaptation is shown by the fact that both radial and basal
Years 1895-1899: downwards is shown by the fact that in the experiments in

Years 1895-1899: I may further recall the fact that the peripheral annuli of
Years 1895-1899: may be accidental is the fact that, as we shall have
Years 1895-1899: the isobutyl compound. Bhis latter fact may be further illustrated by
Years 1895-1899: may be judged by the fact that the reported fertility of
Years 1895-1899: and monkey, lies in the fact that they both may menstruate
Years 1895-1899: in direct opposition to the fact that menstruation may oceur after
Years 1895-1899: may be now added the fact that the effect is produced
Years 1895-1899: centripetally may be mentioned the fact that within certain limits the

Years 1895-1899: the adjacent normal stele. This fact may have some relation to
Years 1895-1899: Stem. The evidence for the fact that roots with the structure

Years 1895-1899: This is owing to the fact that in this form the
Years 1895-1899: form is afforded by the fact that in longitudinal sections their
