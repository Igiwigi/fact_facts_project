Years 1912-1916: alone. He also elicited the fact that no increase in the
Years 1912-1916: of knowledge. But one important fact is clear and well established—the
Years 1912-1916: Callixylon approaches Archwopitys in the fact that most of the primary
Years 1912-1916: their first flower- buds. This fact is of primary importance in
Years 1912-1916: however, is determined by the fact that they are clearly overlain

Years 1912-1916: is clearly the expression of fact that the floral axis is
Years 1912-1916: the excitation current first. This fact is clearly shown by Table

Years 1912-1916: allowance is made for this fact and the somewhat greater margin
Years 1912-1916: BraveEr’s conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the
