Years 1933-1937: Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development

Years 1933-1937: of some interest is the fact (reported later, p. 433) that
Years 1933-1937: interest in view of the fact that some authors have suggested
Years 1933-1937: Of special interest is the fact that any sideward lean of

Years 1933-1937: O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains that it has survived
Years 1933-1937: sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus
Years 1933-1937: has been drawn to the fact that these cords are to
Years 1933-1937: conclusion is drawn from the fact that the part of the
Years 1933-1937: on the available data this fact must be regarded as an
Years 1933-1937: diverticulum (dc.). Owing to the fact that the diverticulum passes to
Years 1933-1937: upon nothing more than the fact that the diverticulum develops as

Years 1933-1937: full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at
Years 1933-1937: far along this path. One fact we may, however, notice at

Years 1933-1937: considerable length of time. This fact also applies for the pennate
Years 1933-1937: of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens
Years 1933-1937: may be associated with the fact that the syrinx has superseded
Years 1933-1937: may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a
Years 1933-1937: pharynx is associated with the fact that the function of the

Years 1933-1937: may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a
Years 1933-1937: with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six
Years 1933-1937: the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating
Years 1933-1937: the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a
Years 1933-1937: on Ditylum Brightwelli, particularly the fact that young auxospores were found
Years 1933-1937: be the most probable. The fact that primary walls do not
Years 1933-1937: tilted. Apart from the primary fact that a utricular macula is
Years 1933-1937: the primary condition. However, the fact that the paired origin of
Years 1933-1937: sub-brachydont and sub-hypsodont beyond the fact that certain species are placed
Years 1933-1937: would seem, resides in the fact that the colour changing reptiles
Years 1933-1937: would be expected from the fact that their ver- tebree have
Years 1933-1937: number would account for the fact that the zooids of a
Years 1933-1937: would not conflict with the fact of the reactivity of the
Years 1933-1937: region. Even if true this fact would provide no evidence of
Years 1933-1937: in great measure to the fact that the great longitudinal sinus
Years 1933-1937: a great distance, until in fact its ventral part came to
Years 1933-1937: was ossified. Owing to the fact that a great deal of
Years 1933-1937: is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is
Years 1933-1937: the vascular system revealed the fact that hardly ever, if at
Years 1933-1937: of the pigmentary effectors. This fact only becomes intelligible on the
Years 1933-1937: used as a jaw. In fact it becomes the palato-quadrate and
Years 1933-1937: for in view of the fact that sensory elements are present
Years 1933-1937: tube feet only in the fact that the sensory elements and
Years 1933-1937: must be inferred from the fact that the denervated skin is
Years 1933-1937: and green vegetables, must in fact be near the border line
Years 1933-1937: must be made for the fact that the older leaves had
Years 1933-1937: In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two
Years 1933-1937: on the available data this fact must be regarded as an

Years 1933-1937: in spring wood by the fact that only the latter have
Years 1933-1937: of prime importance. This latter fact was recognized by AristoTLe who
Years 1933-1937: sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus

Years 1933-1937: fixed angles of inclination. This fact may be illustrated in another
Years 1933-1937: was made possible by the fact that many plants from the

Years 1933-1937: was made possible by the fact that many plants from the
Years 1933-1937: it possible to relate the fact that the fibro- muscular tissue
Years 1933-1937: the black coloration was in fact almost entirely due to its
Years 1933-1937: region. Lastly, there is the fact that in almost all vertebrates
Years 1933-1937: almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the
Years 1933-1937: difficult to see that this fact carries any weight at all
Years 1933-1937: Tables III-V show the remarkable fact that 93 out of 99

Years 1933-1937: fixed angles of inclination. This fact may be illustrated in another
Years 1933-1937: is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present
Years 1933-1937: may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it
Years 1933-1937: may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.
