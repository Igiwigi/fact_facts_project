was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta

would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta

may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb

theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta

"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,that,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb

less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb

is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb

remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta

prob- ably due to the fact that the bulb has a,that,rsta_1936_0011.txt,txt_rsta

harmony with this is the fact that notwithstanding the taller body,this,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb

"recall at this point the fact mentioned on p. 280, and",this,rstb_1932_0004.txt,txt_rstb
apparently racemose in character. This fact suggests a modification in our,this,rstb_1932_0016.txt,txt_rstb
its backstroke. It is this fact of maximum suction towards the,this,rstb_1932_0017.txt,txt_rstb
its early separation is the fact that this membrane is already,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb
this is explained by the fact that another vesicle . .,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb
this condition lies in the fact that it is met with,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb
"and it is an interesting fact that during this period also,",this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb
this condition lies in the fact that the chorionic villi of,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb
"for this lies in the fact that, at the lowest temperatures",this,rsta_1932_0006.txt,txt_rsta

"explain on this theory another fact of observation, namely, that if",this,rsta_1932_0012.txt,txt_rsta

than those in tension. This fact has been well known for,this,rsta_1932_0004.txt,txt_rsta
to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From,this,rsta_1932_0002.txt,txt_rsta
state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta
others. This follows from the fact that the friction varies directly,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta
positive for this value. The fact that ¢ is positive for,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta
This is necessitated by the fact that the lever. being habitually,this,rsta_1933_0003.txt,txt_rsta
from right to left. This fact should be borne in mind,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta
This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta
produced in this record. The fact that a number of sudden,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta

justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta
thickness of the membrane. This fact gives additional weight to the,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta
this is due to the fact that the solution is only,this,rsta_1933_0010.txt,txt_rsta

that of H. wrighti. This fact seems to support the suggestion,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb
a pyramid is not. This fact gives strong support to the,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb
this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb
this stage lies in the fact that the trabecule have undergone,this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb

to its posterior extension. This fact appears to have been pointed,this,rstb_1934_0015.txt,txt_rstb
"the intact side. This striking fact provides further evidence that, when",this,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb

state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta

"vegetative cells were found. This fact shows that resting spores, provided",this,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb

point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,in,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta

: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta

our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,Unknown,Unknown

copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb

their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,is,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb

is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta

temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta

bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb

view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb

may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta

From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb

and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb

This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb

survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb

conclusion is drawn from the fact that the part of the,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb

feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb
"of specimen A, despite the fact that in specimen A the",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta

would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta

may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta

"is solely due to the fact that, in order to obtain",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta
"of this lies in the fact that, while a pronounced “",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta
"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,the,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb

logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb

This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb

"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb

remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,the,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta

to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,the,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta

prob- ably due to the fact that the bulb has a,the,rsta_1936_0011.txt,txt_rsta
to be due to the fact that whilst the adsorbed sulphur,the,rsta_1936_0011.txt,txt_rsta

(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb

to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From,be,rsta_1932_0002.txt,txt_rsta
may be sought in the fact that the former is the,be,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta

be the most probable. The fact that primary walls do not,be,rstb_1934_0017.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta

: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta

our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta

copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb

their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,is,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb

is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb

confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb

"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",is,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,is,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

my researches I used the fact that the population of Holland,the,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb

may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta

"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta

"is solely due to the fact that, in order to obtain",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta
"of this lies in the fact that, while a pronounced “",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta
"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,the,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta

to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta

may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta

is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta

may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta

is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta

"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta

the gases to burn. This fact has several times been conclusively,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta
engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem of,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta

not easy to explain the fact that some fuels behave so,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta
do not readily knock. The fact that the amount of nitrogen,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta

"is solely due to the fact that, in order to obtain",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta
"of this lies in the fact that, while a pronounced “",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta
"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,the,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb

This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb

remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,the,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta

to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,the,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta

prob- ably due to the fact that the bulb has a,the,rsta_1936_0011.txt,txt_rsta

"recall at this point the fact mentioned on p. 280, and",this,rstb_1932_0004.txt,txt_rstb

its early separation is the fact that this membrane is already,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb
this is explained by the fact that another vesicle . .,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb
this condition lies in the fact that it is met with,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb

this condition lies in the fact that the chorionic villi of,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb

to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From,this,rsta_1932_0002.txt,txt_rsta
state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta
others. This follows from the fact that the friction varies directly,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta

This is necessitated by the fact that the lever. being habitually,this,rsta_1933_0003.txt,txt_rsta
from right to left. This fact should be borne in mind,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta
This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta
produced in this record. The fact that a number of sudden,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta

justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta
thickness of the membrane. This fact gives additional weight to the,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta
this is due to the fact that the solution is only,this,rsta_1933_0010.txt,txt_rsta

that of H. wrighti. This fact seems to support the suggestion,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb
a pyramid is not. This fact gives strong support to the,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb
this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb
this stage lies in the fact that the trabecule have undergone,this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb

From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,this,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb

days or more * This fact was referred to elsewhere in,this,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb
"O.M. 82R, p. 160). This fact raises an interesting problem. The",this,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,this,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb
"vegetative cells were found. This fact shows that resting spores, provided",this,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb

This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,this,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb

may be taken of this fact to overcome difficulties in the,this,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb
point emerging from this experiment—the fact that movements of the contained,this,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb

the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb
the xylem is star-shaped. This fact justifies the generic separation of,this,rstb_1929_0008.txt,txt_rstb
The significance of this important fact will be discussed later. The,this,rstb_1929_0007.txt,txt_rstb

"recall at this point the fact mentioned on p. 280, and",this,rstb_1932_0004.txt,txt_rstb
apparently racemose in character. This fact suggests a modification in our,this,rstb_1932_0016.txt,txt_rstb

its early separation is the fact that this membrane is already,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb
this is explained by the fact that another vesicle . .,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb

this condition lies in the fact that the chorionic villi of,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb

state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta
others. This follows from the fact that the friction varies directly,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta
positive for this value. The fact that ¢ is positive for,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta
This is necessitated by the fact that the lever. being habitually,this,rsta_1933_0003.txt,txt_rsta
from right to left. This fact should be borne in mind,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta
This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta
produced in this record. The fact that a number of sudden,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta

justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta
thickness of the membrane. This fact gives additional weight to the,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta
this is due to the fact that the solution is only,this,rsta_1933_0010.txt,txt_rsta

that of H. wrighti. This fact seems to support the suggestion,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb
a pyramid is not. This fact gives strong support to the,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb
this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb
this stage lies in the fact that the trabecule have undergone,this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb

to its posterior extension. This fact appears to have been pointed,this,rstb_1934_0015.txt,txt_rstb

This is correlated with the fact that at this time the,this,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb
