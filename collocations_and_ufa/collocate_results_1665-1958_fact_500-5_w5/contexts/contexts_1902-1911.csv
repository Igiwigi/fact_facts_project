Even more important is the fact that by means of this,this,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta
"curves referred to, and the fact that this effect can already",this,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta

per saltwm. This extremely important fact is illustrated by some of,this,rsta_1904_0011.txt,txt_rsta

primary wood is solid (a fact confirmed by the longitudinal sections,is,rstb_1906_0002.txt,txt_rstb

Hibiscus is shown by the fact that intumescences will form under,is,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb
the underlying tissues. Probably this fact is to be explained by,is,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb
is apparently due to the fact that after the cells have,is,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb
this is shown by the fact that they sometimes contain starch,is,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb

The explanation of this curious fact which suggests itself to me,this,rstb_1903_0006.txt,txt_rstb
in this connection is the fact that principal filaments’ are ontogenetically,this,rstb_1903_0005.txt,txt_rstb

per saltwm. This extremely important fact is illustrated by some of,this,rsta_1904_0011.txt,txt_rsta
first attempt to establish this fact and to determine the curve,this,rsta_1904_0011.txt,txt_rsta

This also appears from the fact that the effect of insolation,this,rsta_1904_0002.txt,txt_rsta

"curves referred to, and the fact that this effect can already",this,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta

in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,this,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta

this extreme case in the fact that a short time only,this,rsta_1911_0002.txt,txt_rsta

The explanation of this curious fact which suggests itself to me,this,rstb_1903_0006.txt,txt_rstb
in this connection is the fact that principal filaments’ are ontogenetically,this,rstb_1903_0005.txt,txt_rstb

(fig. 12). This is a fact which is readily established by,this,rsta_1904_0011.txt,txt_rsta
per saltwm. This extremely important fact is illustrated by some of,this,rsta_1904_0011.txt,txt_rsta
first attempt to establish this fact and to determine the curve,this,rsta_1904_0011.txt,txt_rsta

1857 | The most obvious fact shown by this table is,this,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta
Even more important is the fact that by means of this,this,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta
"curves referred to, and the fact that this effect can already",this,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta
generalised. This theory has in fact taught us on the one,this,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta
in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,this,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta

This is explained by the fact that the velocity of the,this,rsta_1906_0013.txt,txt_rsta

This is explained by the fact that the low temperature of,this,rsta_1906_0003.txt,txt_rsta
Opposed to this is the fact that the embryo is not,this,rstb_1908_0003.txt,txt_rstb

"In this relation an interesting fact was observed, where a minute",this,rstb_1908_0006.txt,txt_rstb

conductivity we attribute to the fact that sodium hydroxide is an,to,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta
to be attributed to the fact that the point of inflexion,to,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta

"to be due to the fact that they were developed slowly,",to,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb
