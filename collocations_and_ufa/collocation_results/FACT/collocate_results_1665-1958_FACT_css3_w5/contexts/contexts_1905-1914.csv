rigidity determinations. Owing to the fact that different observers have expressed,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
due in part to the fact that the wires they used,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
to lay stress on the fact that there is a tendency,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
accuracy on account of the fact that the rigidity determinations in,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be attributed to the fact that the hottest regions of,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
finds considerable support in the fact that the stars give spectra,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
must be connected with the fact that from these metals the,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
was due simply to the fact that from certain light radiators,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
considered in connection with the fact that the secondary radiation from,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
small to account for the fact that the rigidity of these,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
not borne out by the fact that some of the fibres,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

This is due to the fact that the‘supply of C due,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

is partially explained by the fact that my comparisons were at,that,rsta_1905_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be due to the fact that the method of producing,that,rsta_1905_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
formula has been employed. The fact that in any determination of,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

is really attributable to the fact that the mean sun-spot frequency,that,rsta_1905_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

I drew attention to the fact that these figures bear to,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
I was encouraged by the fact that M. Le Roux himself,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

"curves referred to, and the fact that this effect can already",that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
(S—8’). This follows from the fact that the maximum (minimum) at,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
result is easily deduced. The fact that the value at a,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
argument is independent of the fact that 8 is a finite,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

is partly due to the fact that the rate of flow,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
"average one, partly to the fact that all the vessels are",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,that,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28 for,that,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

for this suggestion is the fact that the plinth is wanting,that,rstb_1905_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24

on the vegetative organs. The fact that the cupular glands are,that,rstb_1905_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24
hours. It is a curious fact that the corrected readings of,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
for it is a well-established fact that the values of the,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
rigidities was complicated by the fact that the wire gradually drew,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
obtained. This accounts for the fact that in two or three,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

"irregular results, complicated by the fact that the logarithmic decrement of",that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
rigidity determinations. Owing to the fact that different observers have expressed,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
due in part to the fact that the wires they used,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
to lay stress on the fact that there is a tendency,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
accuracy on account of the fact that the rigidity determinations in,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be attributed to the fact that the hottest regions of,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
finds considerable support in the fact that the stars give spectra,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
must be connected with the fact that from these metals the,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
was due simply to the fact that from certain light radiators,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
considered in connection with the fact that the secondary radiation from,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
small to account for the fact that the rigidity of these,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
not borne out by the fact that some of the fibres,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may possibly lie in the fact that the structure of fused,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
unchanged ThX present. The observed fact that the hydroxide regains its,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

by myself lies in the fact that the former did not,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is an expression of the fact that the change is of,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
This is due to the fact that the‘supply of C due,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

is partially explained by the fact that my comparisons were at,that,rsta_1905_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be due to the fact that the method of producing,that,rsta_1905_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
formula has been employed. The fact that in any determination of,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
first method lies in the fact that the connecting tubes and,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is really attributable to the fact that the mean sun-spot frequency,that,rsta_1905_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

I drew attention to the fact that these figures bear to,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
I was encouraged by the fact that M. Le Roux himself,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

to be attributed to the fact that the point of inflexion,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
"solutions, and also to the fact that a parabolic curve has",that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
"curves referred to, and the fact that this effect can already",that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is mainly due to the fact that the slope of the,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
(S—8’). This follows from the fact that the maximum (minimum) at,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
result is easily deduced. The fact that the value at a,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
argument is independent of the fact that 8 is a finite,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

"are relatively rigid, and the fact that their internal walls are",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is partly due to the fact that the rate of flow,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
"average one, partly to the fact that all the vessels are",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
discrepancy is due to the fact that in elder stems water,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

"actual amount, and, secondly, the fact that the amount of flow",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
being probably due to the fact that a little of the,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is readily explained by the fact that the vessels are irregularly,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

is possibly owing to the fact that the rate of flow,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
to the radius itself. The fact that in the first column,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,that,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28 for,that,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

is possibly owing to this fact that these measurements give values,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24

this phenomenon is doubtless the fact that in the smaller bronchioles,is,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24

support is derived from the fact that the photo-electric effect sets,from,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24

THE ORIGIN OF THE The fact that the negative emission from,from,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

is borne out by the fact that very few survive more,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
"in the laboratory, and the fact that the two forms are",the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

"in maternal inheritance, despite the fact that elimination only takes place",the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

has drawn attention to this fact with regard to the inheritance,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
gains further support from the fact ON THE EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION OF,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
bringing about some change. The fact that no such change took,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
may be compared with the fact that in 1912 most of,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
results at least emphasize the fact that it is necessary to,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

to be expected from the fact that all the lines referred,the,rsta_1914_0022.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

THE ORIGIN OF THE The fact that the negative emission from,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
may be quite inappreciable. The fact that chemical action and rise,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
is doubtless due to the fact that the emission from the,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
"components, on account of the fact that the epochs are changing",the,rsta_1914_0020.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

may be due to the fact that THRELFALL’s observations are all,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
this was found in the fact that by fitting a bell,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

the change of resistance. In fact this point confines the present,the,rsta_1914_0023.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

group is indicated by the fact that these lines occur under,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28 for,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

Attention is drawn to the fact that the higher charges are,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

sometimes shattered into pieces. The fact that no tamping is necessary,the,rsta_1914_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
explanation gains weight from the fact that at perigee the lunar,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

"“law of continuity,” and the fact that our mathematics is applied",the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
This agrees with the known fact that at tropical stations the,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

in the main from the fact already noticed in connection with,the,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
significance probably attaches to the fact that 2’s are slightly more,the,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

may be drawn to the fact that no “ smoothed curves”,the,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

"in the opposite direction. In fact it becomes 6°912000, 3471 below",the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
above points rather to the fact that we have to do,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
possibility of doing this. In fact Ryppere’s tables give the limit,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
wide for absolute certainty. In fact better agreement on the whole,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

very good demonstration of the fact that at +3°6 C. the,the,rstb_1905_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24

accuracy on account of the fact that the rigidity determinations in,the,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

explanation gains weight from the fact that at perigee the lunar,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

Rigidity of a Stem. The fact that the water is mainly,is,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is also shown by the fact that the sound main trunk,is,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
needed by them. (2) The fact that this action is no,is,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

"give us information, confirms the fact that there is no ancestrous",is,rstb_1906_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
theory is disproved by the fact stated above that ovulation in,is,rstb_1906_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
corpus luteum is untenable. The fact that in a very large,is,rstb_1906_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
Hibiscus is shown by the fact that intumescences will form under,is,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
the underlying tissues. Probably this fact is to be explained by,is,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is apparently due to the fact that after the cells have,is,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
this is shown by the fact that they sometimes contain starch,is,rstb_1906_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

is also indicated by the fact that in the adult egg,is,rstb_1906_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
peculiar to this period. The fact that the nuclear irregularity is,is,rstb_1906_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
"is considerably strengthened by the fact that, as we have seen",is,rstb_1906_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

"errors of measurement, and the fact that the discrepancy is different",is,rsta_1908_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24

is borne out by the fact that very few survive more,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
"in the laboratory, and the fact that the two forms are",the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

"in maternal inheritance, despite the fact that elimination only takes place",the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

gains further support from the fact ON THE EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION OF,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
bringing about some change. The fact that no such change took,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
may be compared with the fact that in 1912 most of,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
results at least emphasize the fact that it is necessary to,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

to be expected from the fact that all the lines referred,the,rsta_1914_0022.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

THE ORIGIN OF THE The fact that the negative emission from,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
may be quite inappreciable. The fact that chemical action and rise,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
is doubtless due to the fact that the emission from the,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

may be due to the fact that THRELFALL’s observations are all,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
this was found in the fact that by fitting a bell,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

the change of resistance. In fact this point confines the present,the,rsta_1914_0023.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

group is indicated by the fact that these lines occur under,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28 for,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

explanation gains weight from the fact that at perigee the lunar,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

"“law of continuity,” and the fact that our mathematics is applied",the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
This agrees with the known fact that at tropical stations the,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

may be drawn to the fact that no “ smoothed curves”,the,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

"in the opposite direction. In fact it becomes 6°912000, 3471 below",the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

very good demonstration of the fact that at +3°6 C. the,the,rstb_1905_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24

accuracy on account of the fact that the rigidity determinations in,the,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

has drawn attention to this fact with regard to the inheritance,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
gains further support from the fact ON THE EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION OF,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
bringing about some change. The fact that no such change took,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
may be compared with the fact that in 1912 most of,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
results at least emphasize the fact that it is necessary to,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

THE ORIGIN OF THE The fact that the negative emission from,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
may be quite inappreciable. The fact that chemical action and rise,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
is doubtless due to the fact that the emission from the,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

may be due to the fact that THRELFALL’s observations are all,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
this was found in the fact that by fitting a bell,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

group is indicated by the fact that these lines occur under,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28 for,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

sometimes shattered into pieces. The fact that no tamping is necessary,the,rsta_1914_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
explanation gains weight from the fact that at perigee the lunar,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

"“law of continuity,” and the fact that our mathematics is applied",the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
This agrees with the known fact that at tropical stations the,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

may be drawn to the fact that no “ smoothed curves”,the,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

"in the opposite direction. In fact it becomes 6°912000, 3471 below",the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
above points rather to the fact that we have to do,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
possibility of doing this. In fact Ryppere’s tables give the limit,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24

Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24

in the large flow. This fact would tend to minimise the,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
is possibly owing to this fact that these measurements give values,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
against this assumption is the fact that the rat which died,this,rstb_1912_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

"to this hypothesis is the fact that, hitherto, impressions of C.",this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24
evidence is furnished from the fact that leaves of this type,this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

but as a matter of fact this same homogeneous structure is,of,rsta_1912_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
is partly due to the fact that the bursting- point of,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
from details explains the general fact of the isothermal region. If,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24

BraveEr’s conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the,of,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24
and is due to the fact that want of oxygen aids,of,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24

is partly due to the fact that the bursting- point of,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
from details explains the general fact of the isothermal region. If,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24

of the solid metal. The fact that the terms depend on,of,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24

"different stations vary, and the fact that the scale of values",of,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24
more short of this. The fact reminded me of Prof. Scuuster’s,of,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24

as a pollen-collecting funnel. The fact that the edges of the,of,rstb_1914_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

but as a matter of fact this same homogeneous structure is,of,rsta_1912_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
is partly due to the fact that the bursting- point of,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
from details explains the general fact of the isothermal region. If,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24

BraveEr’s conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the,of,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24
and is due to the fact that want of oxygen aids,of,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24
is due firstly to the fact that the normal level of,of,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24

"different stations vary, and the fact that the scale of values",of,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24

"evidence of this most important fact is given below (text-figs. 17,",of,rstb_1912_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

It is a very remarkable fact that they are of the,of,rstb_1912_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

particularly in view of the fact that in the great majority,of,rsta_1912_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
but as a matter of fact this same homogeneous structure is,of,rsta_1912_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
is partly due to the fact that the bursting- point of,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
from details explains the general fact of the isothermal region. If,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24
may be deduced from the fact that the formation of cirrus,of,rsta_1912_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1912,24

BraveEr’s conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the,of,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24
and is due to the fact that want of oxygen aids,of,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24
is due firstly to the fact that the normal level of,of,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,24

of the solid metal. The fact that the terms depend on,of,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24
This is due to the fact that the paths of the,of,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24

"different stations vary, and the fact that the scale of values",of,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24
more short of this. The fact reminded me of Prof. Scuuster’s,of,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24
con- sequence of the known fact that while a highly disturbed,of,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913,24

"in the Araucarians. Moreover, the fact that the ray pitting of",of,rstb_1914_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

is clearly the expression of fact that the floral axis is,of,rstb_1914_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
as a pollen-collecting funnel. The fact that the edges of the,of,rstb_1914_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24
only direct indication of the fact that the ancestral Welwitschia presented,of,rstb_1914_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1914,24

the other hand is the fact that in no case of,that,rstb_1905_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24

for this suggestion is the fact that the plinth is wanting,that,rstb_1905_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24
"top, as shown by the fact that most of the seeds",that,rstb_1905_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24
of the cupule is the fact that it was infested with,that,rstb_1905_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24
on the vegetative organs. The fact that the cupular glands are,that,rstb_1905_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24
hours. It is a curious fact that the corrected readings of,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
for it is a well-established fact that the values of the,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
rigidities was complicated by the fact that the wire gradually drew,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
obtained. This accounts for the fact that in two or three,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
use was made of the fact that it had already been,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
"irregular results, complicated by the fact that the logarithmic decrement of",that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
rigidity determinations. Owing to the fact that different observers have expressed,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
due in part to the fact that the wires they used,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
to lay stress on the fact that there is a tendency,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
accuracy on account of the fact that the rigidity determinations in,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be attributed to the fact that the hottest regions of,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
finds considerable support in the fact that the stars give spectra,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
must be connected with the fact that from these metals the,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
was due simply to the fact that from certain light radiators,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
considered in connection with the fact that the secondary radiation from,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
small to account for the fact that the rigidity of these,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
not borne out by the fact that some of the fibres,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may possibly lie in the fact that the structure of fused,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
unchanged ThX present. The observed fact that the hydroxide regains its,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
actinium is due to the fact that the deposited SUCCESSION OF,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
by myself lies in the fact that the former did not,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is an expression of the fact that the change is of,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
This is due to the fact that the‘supply of C due,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
"emanation, is due to the fact that there are two successive",that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

due in part to the fact that the radiations from the,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
"gases, in consequence of the fact that the observed ratio of",that,rsta_1905_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is partially explained by the fact that my comparisons were at,that,rsta_1905_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be due to the fact that the method of producing,that,rsta_1905_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
formula has been employed. The fact that in any determination of,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
first method lies in the fact that the connecting tubes and,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is really attributable to the fact that the mean sun-spot frequency,that,rsta_1905_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
number of sun-spot periods. The fact that in Table XX. a,that,rsta_1905_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
I drew attention to the fact that these figures bear to,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
I was encouraged by the fact that M. Le Roux himself,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is necessary owing to the fact that it is very difficult,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
+ It is a strange fact that the index of Hy,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
"refracting power, and the allied fact that a double or treble",that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

universally applicable as expressing the fact that the specific conductivity «,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
have been impressed with the fact that combination between solvent and,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
Even more important is the fact that by means of this,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
solutions is found in the fact that the carbonate is almost,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

to be attributed to the fact that the point of inflexion,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
"solutions, and also to the fact that a parabolic curve has",that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
"curves referred to, and the fact that this effect can already",that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is mainly due to the fact that the slope of the,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
(S—8’). This follows from the fact that the maximum (minimum) at,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
result is easily deduced. The fact that the value at a,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
argument is independent of the fact that 8 is a finite,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
favourable specimens are available. The fact that bundles are seen leaving,that,rstb_1906_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

"are relatively rigid, and the fact that their internal walls are",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is partly due to the fact that the rate of flow,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
"average one, partly to the fact that all the vessels are",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
discrepancy is due to the fact that in elder stems water,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
"the foregoing calculations. Firstly, the fact that the amount of flow",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
"actual amount, and, secondly, the fact that the amount of flow",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
being probably due to the fact that a little of the,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is readily explained by the fact that the vessels are irregularly,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
gained from the wood. The fact that slow lateral diffusion into,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

on the vegetative organs. The fact that the cupular glands are,that,rstb_1905_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24

for it is a well-established fact that the values of the,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
rigidities was complicated by the fact that the wire gradually drew,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

due in part to the fact that the wires they used,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
to lay stress on the fact that there is a tendency,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
accuracy on account of the fact that the rigidity determinations in,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be attributed to the fact that the hottest regions of,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
finds considerable support in the fact that the stars give spectra,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
must be connected with the fact that from these metals the,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
was due simply to the fact that from certain light radiators,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
considered in connection with the fact that the secondary radiation from,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
small to account for the fact that the rigidity of these,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
not borne out by the fact that some of the fibres,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

by myself lies in the fact that the former did not,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is an expression of the fact that the change is of,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
This is due to the fact that the‘supply of C due,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

is partially explained by the fact that my comparisons were at,that,rsta_1905_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be due to the fact that the method of producing,that,rsta_1905_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
formula has been employed. The fact that in any determination of,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
first method lies in the fact that the connecting tubes and,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is really attributable to the fact that the mean sun-spot frequency,that,rsta_1905_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

I drew attention to the fact that these figures bear to,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
I was encouraged by the fact that M. Le Roux himself,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

to be attributed to the fact that the point of inflexion,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

"curves referred to, and the fact that this effect can already",that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is mainly due to the fact that the slope of the,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
(S—8’). This follows from the fact that the maximum (minimum) at,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
result is easily deduced. The fact that the value at a,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
argument is independent of the fact that 8 is a finite,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

is partly due to the fact that the rate of flow,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
"average one, partly to the fact that all the vessels are",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

"actual amount, and, secondly, the fact that the amount of flow",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
being probably due to the fact that a little of the,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is readily explained by the fact that the vessels are irregularly,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

to the radius itself. The fact that in the first column,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,that,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,24
