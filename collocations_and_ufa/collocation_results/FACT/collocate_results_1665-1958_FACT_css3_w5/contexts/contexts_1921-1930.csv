of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

may be due to the fact that segmental excretory organs are,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
muscles of the maxillule. The fact that in the so-called nauplius,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"still unsettled, and hence the fact that the opening of the",that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"of the gland, the simple fact that in the base of",that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
with its nephrostome. But the fact that the valve rudi- ment,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
of the endoskeletal system. The fact just mentioned that the valve,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
no doubt arises from the fact that food substances are continually,that,rstb_1926_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1926
pro- bably due to the fact that they were more strongly,that,rstb_1926_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"the definitive oocytes. From the fact that all the oocytes, in",that,rstb_1926_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1926

germ-layer seems to establish the fact that the mitochondria shrink gradually,that,rstb_1926_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"the logical one, from the fact that otherwise reference to the",that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

for stating this being the fact that we have just recently,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that in the case of,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

The absolute extent and the fact that it passes through the,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
results there is first the fact that the number of eggs,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the Hercynian movements. When that fact is allowed for, a striking",that,rstb_1925_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1925
may be due to the fact that segmental excretory organs are,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
muscles of the maxillule. The fact that in the so-called nauplius,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"still unsettled, and hence the fact that the opening of the",that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"of the gland, the simple fact that in the base of",that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
with its nephrostome. But the fact that the valve rudi- ment,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
of the endoskeletal system. The fact just mentioned that the valve,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
no doubt arises from the fact that food substances are continually,that,rstb_1926_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1926
pro- bably due to the fact that they were more strongly,that,rstb_1926_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1926

germ-layer seems to establish the fact that the mitochondria shrink gradually,that,rstb_1926_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"the logical one, from the fact that otherwise reference to the",that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

for stating this being the fact that we have just recently,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that in the case of,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

The absolute extent and the fact that it passes through the,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

be drawn to a curious fact constantly observed in the material,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921

be drawn to a curious fact constantly observed in the material,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921
in several other species. The fact that StiLEs does not figure,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921

"the Hercynian movements. When that fact is allowed for, a striking",is,rstb_1925_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the,is,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

from these results is the fact that for the integrated radiation,is,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

this is a point of fact on which my conclusion was,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

that even allowing for the fact that it is the highest,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
extraordinarily close. It is in fact better than one has any,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is to be added the fact that errors of sampling in,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"and below is examined, the fact that the effect can extend",is,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

especially taking into account the fact that Fraunhofer lines appear to,the,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

considerable difficulty arose from the fact that the manganese spectrum is,the,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923

p. 161 below). § This fact might indicate that the scales,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
must be drawn to the fact that on many of the,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"far as observed, in the fact that the sieve-plates are always",the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

leaf-traces of Asteroxylon in the fact that they stop short at,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
I attribute largely to the fact that the implants were always,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that the phenomena of invasion",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"they become. Owing to the fact that, quite apart from mitotic",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon granules could,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
specimens of lung. But one fact stands out: the alveolay epithelial,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
high correlations lies in the fact that the particular variates chosen,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
chosen because they appear in fact to be associated with the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells,",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
follows at once from the fact that the distri- bution of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"if not wholly, by the fact that the mortality, in any",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the charts, and are in fact an integral part of the",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
plot. In view of this fact we cannot deny the possibility,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"with the rainy periods. The fact of the coincidence, whether causal",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"of the same parameter. The fact that z,, «4, ¢ are",the,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928

is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928
its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928

number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929

The discrepancy arises from the fact that DaNGEARD’S paper was not,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

must be drawn to the fact that on many of the,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

I attribute largely to the fact that the implants were always,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that the phenomena of invasion",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon granules could,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
specimens of lung. But one fact stands out: the alveolay epithelial,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
high correlations lies in the fact that the particular variates chosen,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
chosen because they appear in fact to be associated with the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of the observations themselves. In fact the fit is so close,is,rsta_1923_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1923
considerable difficulty arose from the fact that the manganese spectrum is,is,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923
difficulty is caused by the fact that the lines are grouped,is,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923

above we have used the fact that C?R(C®) is zero by,is,rsta_1923_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1923

"Research, Most striking is the fact that in all three types",is,rstb_1924_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",is,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924
is also strictly comparable. The fact that in Estheria the connection,is,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924
comparison is supported by the fact that fluid of some sort,is,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"B, and it is in fact clear that the general solution",is,rsta_1924_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1924
Thus our process is in fact valid for a much more,is,rsta_1924_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1924

"the expression for K,. In fact K, is the induced electric",is,rsta_1924_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1924
This is explainable by the fact that since the velocity of,is,rsta_1924_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1924
is also shown by the fact that at their distal ends,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this is a point of fact on which my conclusion was,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

such a manner ? The fact that the cicatricial epithelium is,is,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
that even allowing for the fact that it is the highest,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
identical. As a matter of fact the winter dip is slightly,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
extraordinarily close. It is in fact better than one has any,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is to be added the fact that errors of sampling in,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

Sagenopteris is indicated by the fact that some earlier authors placed,is,rstb_1925_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of this region is the fact that many of the tributaries,is,rstb_1925_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the Hercynian movements. When that fact is allowed for, a striking",is,rstb_1925_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the,is,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,is,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"and below is examined, the fact that the effect can extend",is,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"to this view is the fact that, while the latter are",is,rstb_1926_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that the plates through which,is,rstb_1926_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1926

view is supported by the fact that this part of the,is,rstb_1926_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1926
is further supported by the fact that an independent pharyngohyal cartilage,is,rstb_1926_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1926
is accurately known from the fact that the interval separating the,is,rsta_1926_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1926

OF quantities agree. The important fact is that ~/I1s — +/2p,is,rsta_1926_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1926

from these results is the fact that for the integrated radiation,is,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

considerable difficulty arose from the fact that the manganese spectrum is,is,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923
difficulty is caused by the fact that the lines are grouped,is,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923

is also shown by the fact that at their distal ends,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this is a point of fact on which my conclusion was,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

that even allowing for the fact that it is the highest,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
extraordinarily close. It is in fact better than one has any,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is to be added the fact that errors of sampling in,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

The discrepancy arises from the fact that DaNGEARD’S paper was not,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

p. 161 below). § This fact might indicate that the scales,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
must be drawn to the fact that on many of the,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"far as observed, in the fact that the sieve-plates are always",the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

leaf-traces of Asteroxylon in the fact that they stop short at,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
I attribute largely to the fact that the implants were always,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that the phenomena of invasion",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"they become. Owing to the fact that, quite apart from mitotic",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon granules could,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
specimens of lung. But one fact stands out: the alveolay epithelial,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
high correlations lies in the fact that the particular variates chosen,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
chosen because they appear in fact to be associated with the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells,",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
follows at once from the fact that the distri- bution of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the charts, and are in fact an integral part of the",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
plot. In view of this fact we cannot deny the possibility,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"with the rainy periods. The fact of the coincidence, whether causal",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
period must be set the fact that in our diagrams the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

can be based on the fact that we have no experience,the,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
due no doubt to the fact that the two sets of,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

find further illustration in the fact that the percentages hatched in,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

may be due to the fact that segmental excretory organs are,the,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

from the Sinusoidal Form.—In actual fact the wave of electromotive force,the,rsta_1928_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1928
as is shown by the fact that the series obtained by,the,rsta_1928_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1928
this is confirmed by the fact that for a considerable portion,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928
arrangement is conditioned by the fact that in the adjusted es,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928

labour is ofiset by the fact that in practice there is,the,rsta_1928_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1928
"of the same parameter. The fact that z,, «4, ¢ are",the,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928

in the wrong direction. The fact that so big a difference,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928
is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928
its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928

number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929

"explanation is found for the fact that, at high altitudes, the",the,rstb_1923_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1923

"by the reticulated counts, a fact which may have to do",the,rstb_1923_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1923
The true explanation of this fact will likely be found in,the,rstb_1923_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1923

"the approximation (10) and the fact (4), the vertical dynamical equation",the,rsta_1923_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1923

The resistance coefficient does in fact fall continu- ously with increase,the,rsta_1923_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1923

"the oscillations be small, this fact limits the range of possible",the,rsta_1923_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1923
so is due to the fact that the helix effect as,the,rsta_1923_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1923

from these results is the fact that for the integrated radiation,the,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923
still remains ; but the fact that the agreement results from,the,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923
especially taking into account the fact that Fraunhofer lines appear to,the,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923
formula (22) somewhat obscures the fact that the emergent radiation is,the,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

considerable difficulty arose from the fact that the manganese spectrum is,the,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923

The discrepancy arises from the fact that DaNGEARD’S paper was not,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

p. 161 below). § This fact might indicate that the scales,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
must be drawn to the fact that on many of the,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"far as observed, in the fact that the sieve-plates are always",the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

leaf-traces of Asteroxylon in the fact that they stop short at,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
I attribute largely to the fact that the implants were always,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that the phenomena of invasion",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"they become. Owing to the fact that, quite apart from mitotic",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon granules could,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
specimens of lung. But one fact stands out: the alveolay epithelial,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
high correlations lies in the fact that the particular variates chosen,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
chosen because they appear in fact to be associated with the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells,",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
follows at once from the fact that the distri- bution of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"if not wholly, by the fact that the mortality, in any",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the charts, and are in fact an integral part of the",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
plot. In view of this fact we cannot deny the possibility,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"with the rainy periods. The fact of the coincidence, whether causal",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
period must be set the fact that in our diagrams the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"this period, allowing for the fact that adjacent points are not",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

can be based on the fact that we have no knowledge,the,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925

due no doubt to the fact that the two sets of,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928
its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928

number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929

this is supported by a fact to which Prof. Hass has,this,rsta_1923_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1923

"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",this,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924

out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

appreciable.§ MaxweE.t suggested that this fact might provide a possible explanation,this,rsta_1923_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1923
"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",this,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"symmetrical with it, whereas in fact this latter vessel is asymmetrical",this,rstb_1924_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1924
This was due to the fact that the grating employed was,this,rsta_1924_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1924
through the zero. From this fact we may draw two important,this,rsta_1924_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1924

out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"this period, allowing for the fact that adjacent points are not",this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated,this,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

remaining test depended on the fact that if change of temperature,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
results there is first the fact that the number of eggs,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

may be due to the fact that segmental excretory organs are,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
Antennal Gland. Owing to this fact and the fact that there,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
muscles of the maxillule. The fact that in the so-called nauplius,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"still unsettled, and hence the fact that the opening of the",that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"of the gland, the simple fact that in the base of",that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
of the endoskeletal system. The fact just mentioned that the valve,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
no doubt arises from the fact that food substances are continually,that,rstb_1926_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1926
pro- bably due to the fact that they were more strongly,that,rstb_1926_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"the logical one, from the fact that otherwise reference to the",that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

for stating this being the fact that we have just recently,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that in the case of,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

The absolute extent and the fact that it passes through the,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,that,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
muscles of the maxillule. The fact that in the so-called nauplius,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"still unsettled, and hence the fact that the opening of the",that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"of the gland, the simple fact that in the base of",that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
of the endoskeletal system. The fact just mentioned that the valve,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
no doubt arises from the fact that food substances are continually,that,rstb_1926_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1926
pro- bably due to the fact that they were more strongly,that,rstb_1926_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1926

germ-layer seems to establish the fact that the mitochondria shrink gradually,that,rstb_1926_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1926
"the logical one, from the fact that otherwise reference to the",that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

for stating this being the fact that we have just recently,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that in the case of,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

The absolute extent and the fact that it passes through the,that,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
