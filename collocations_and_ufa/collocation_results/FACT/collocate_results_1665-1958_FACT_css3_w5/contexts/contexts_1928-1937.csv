One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"Callorhynchus, shows that despite the fact that the region of the",that,rstb_1935_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when there is asymmetry,",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains that it has survived",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
region. In view of the fact that this layer has not,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30

to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not sufficiently",that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
part of the scheme; the fact that they were generated independently,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
; there is also the fact that at a speed of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

difficulty was occasioned by the fact that in this case neither,that,rsta_1934_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Orr.** In spite of the fact that its general validity remains,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
6: this follows from the fact that in general 2 cos,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
equilibrium diagrams now reveals the fact that where the alomic size,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when there is asymmetry,",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains that it has survived",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

to be supported by the fact that breaks in the chain,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

This was based upon the fact that in the forms which,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
region. In view of the fact that this layer has not,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
load between the surfaces. The fact that oleic acid gives less,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
treatment with boiling water. This fact seems to indicate clearly that,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"electric field, consequent on the fact that the limit of the",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
showed the typical figure. The fact that many of these particles,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

crystal can be understood. The fact that the edges of the,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem of,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,that,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
principles underlying the theory. The fact that I is not zero,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

produced in this record. The fact that a number of sudden,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
thickness of the membrane. This fact gives additional weight to the,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
this is due to the fact that the solution is only,this,rsta_1933_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
about 5 per cent. The fact that this mean value of,this,rsta_1933_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

that of H. wrighti. This fact seems to support the suggestion,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
a pyramid is not. This fact gives strong support to the,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
this stage lies in the fact that the trabecule have undergone,this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
"the olfactory sac, but this fact is no objection to the",this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
and the Chelonia. This latter fact may perhaps be regarded as,this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
to its posterior extension. This fact appears to have been pointed,this,rstb_1934_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

This is correlated with the fact that at this time the,this,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
"far along this path. One fact we may, however, notice at",this,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

"mesenteries of connective tissue. This fact has considerable significance, since it",this,rstb_1937_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,this,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"vegetative cells were found. This fact shows that resting spores, provided",this,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,this,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
This is due to the fact that they are largely determined,this,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30
this in spite of the fact that some of the measurements,this,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30
this recommendation lies in the fact that the three steps g,this,rsta_1937_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30
This correlation corresponds to the fact that corresponding significant entries in,this,rsta_1937_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30
this is due to the fact that although the sun does,this,rsta_1937_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30
do this owing to the fact that they possessed narrow opercular,this,rstb_1928_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30

attached to this feature. The fact that there is no “,this,rstb_1928_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30
to isolate it. But this fact iselfis no valid argument in,this,rstb_1928_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30
this in spite of the fact that ground- up shells form,this,rstb_1928_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30
this is confirmed by the fact that for a considerable portion,this,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
= 0. This expresses the fact that the 0 end of,this,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
section. This example illustrates the fact that the existence of a,this,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30
the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30
the xylem is star-shaped. This fact justifies the generic separation of,this,rstb_1929_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30

centro- parietal lobe by the fact that this part more than,this,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
lobe as appears from the fact that this sulcus and its,this,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
the Madurese and with the fact that this cytotectonic field is,this,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
"must have been young. This fact is significant, for the results",this,rstb_1932_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
Ia was a leaf. This fact is at present difficult to,this,rstb_1932_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
"no doubt due to the fact that in this experiment I,a",this,rstb_1932_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
"in the plastochron, and this fact helps to explain them. For",this,rstb_1932_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
"recall at this point the fact mentioned on p. 280, and",this,rstb_1932_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
apparently racemose in character. This fact suggests a modification in our,this,rstb_1932_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
its backstroke. It is this fact of maximum suction towards the,this,rstb_1932_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
its early separation is the fact that this membrane is already,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
this is explained by the fact that another vesicle . .,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
this condition lies in the fact that it is met with,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
"and it is an interesting fact that during this period also,",this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
this condition lies in the fact that the chorionic villi of,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
"for this lies in the fact that, at the lowest temperatures",this,rsta_1932_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
takes place. Neglect of this fact is the cause of the,this,rsta_1932_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
"explain on this theory another fact of observation, namely, that if",this,rsta_1932_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
communicated. Perhaps the most interesting fact about this investigation is that,this,rsta_1932_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
exceeds 0-46 per cent. This fact finds its explanation in the,this,rsta_1932_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
showed different amounts. This same fact did not escape the observant,this,rsta_1932_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
on the second hyperbola. The fact that this are never closes,this,rsta_1932_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
than those in tension. This fact has been well known for,this,rsta_1932_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From,this,rsta_1932_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
others. This follows from the fact that the friction varies directly,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
positive for this value. The fact that ¢ is positive for,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
This is necessitated by the fact that the lever. being habitually,this,rsta_1933_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
from right to left. This fact should be borne in mind,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
produced in this record. The fact that a number of sudden,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
the Western Ghats. Considering this fact and assuming that the average,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
thickness of the membrane. This fact gives additional weight to the,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
this is due to the fact that the solution is only,this,rsta_1933_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
about 5 per cent. The fact that this mean value of,this,rsta_1933_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

is further facilitated by the fact that this part of the,this,rstb_1934_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

that of H. wrighti. This fact seems to support the suggestion,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
a pyramid is not. This fact gives strong support to the,this,rstb_1934_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
this stage lies in the fact that the trabecule have undergone,this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
"the olfactory sac, but this fact is no objection to the",this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
and the Chelonia. This latter fact may perhaps be regarded as,this,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
to its posterior extension. This fact appears to have been pointed,this,rstb_1934_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
"the intact side. This striking fact provides further evidence that, when",this,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

This is correlated with the fact that at this time the,this,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
"far along this path. One fact we may, however, notice at",this,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,in,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,is,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
quantum equilibrium. It is this fact which makes us consider a,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
suggestion is supported by the fact that in both the previous,is,rstb_1935_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

elevations. It is a significant fact also that tubercles are not,is,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently overlooked that,is,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,is,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

Even its position is in fact different in that it is,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,is,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,is,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,is,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
quantum equilibrium. It is this fact which makes us consider a,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
suggestion is supported by the fact that in both the previous,is,rstb_1935_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,is,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,is,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
elevations. It is a significant fact also that tubercles are not,is,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently overlooked that,is,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"is made improbable by the fact that, although hernia is very",is,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,is,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,is,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",is,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",is,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,is,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

as is shown by the fact that the series obtained by,the,rsta_1928_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
this is confirmed by the fact that for a considerable portion,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
arrangement is conditioned by the fact that in the adjusted es,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

labour is ofiset by the fact that in practice there is,the,rsta_1928_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
"of the same parameter. The fact that z,, «4, ¢ are",the,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
one had even 0-0. The fact is that the size of,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30
the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30
number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30

"explanation may lie in the fact that, as pointed out by",the,rstb_1932_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
at high speeds does in fact approximate to the irrotational flow,the,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"the form * {must in fact vanish with , and {,",the,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"the plate ; if in fact the solution makes u, equal",the,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

will be mentioned. (1) The fact that the molybdate solution 502,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,the,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,the,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30

shown (P. 501) by the fact that it can be displaced,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"of specimen A, despite the fact that in specimen A the",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

the same phenomenon. Certainly the fact that a niche is present,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

features go to establish the fact that this large oper- cular,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"in any way elongated, in fact rather contracted, so that the",the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

the difficulties introduced by the fact that the probability law (70),the,rsta_1937_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30

its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30

"too, further complicated by the fact that manganese steel, which has",the,rsta_1934_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"Finally, there is the interesting fact that carbon, when added to",the,rsta_1934_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"has been taken of the fact that we may omit M,,s",the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"the form * {must in fact vanish with , and {,",the,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"the plate ; if in fact the solution makes u, equal",the,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"indicate little apart from the fact that thick clumps of ash,",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,the,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30

feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

days or more * This fact was referred to elsewhere in,to,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
it possible to relate the fact that the fibro- muscular tissue,to,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
This is due to the fact that only those D cells,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

no reference made to the fact that the square pattern is,is,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,is,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

more practical importance than the fact that the traction is of,is,rsta_1928_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
as is shown by the fact that the series obtained by,is,rsta_1928_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,is,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
quantum equilibrium. It is this fact which makes us consider a,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
suggestion is supported by the fact that in both the previous,is,rstb_1935_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

elevations. It is a significant fact also that tubercles are not,is,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,the,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30

base this view on the fact that Srensio’s suggested restoration of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"may be afforded by the fact that in Pterychthiodes, which StENsto",the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
the ductus endolymphaticus and the fact that there probably was a,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
the dermal bones. (7) The fact that the ductus endolymphaticus perforated,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
the vena hyoidea. (10) The fact that the palato-quadrates as far,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

shown (P. 501) by the fact that it can be displaced,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"of specimen A, despite the fact that in specimen A the",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

"crown of the tooth, in fact it is recogniz- able before",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

"nodules of later stages, in fact represent the mesodermal contents of",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
the same phenomenon. Certainly the fact that a niche is present,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
“‘endostichos”’ are differentiated by the fact that the members of the,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
features go to establish the fact that this large oper- cular,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

is rendered doubtful by the fact that is it a shallower,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
; being satisfied with the fact that the pars ventralis is,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
perhaps an expression of the fact that in these cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
verticalis sufficiently accounts for the fact that the area striata does,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
lunatus is evidenced by the fact that the cortex immediately behind,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
"in any way elongated, in fact rather contracted, so that the",the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
parietal lobule indicated by the fact that there are no sulci,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

"portrayed, as is also the fact that the sulcus frontalis inferior",the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

"these two types contrast, the fact that a combination of the",the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

This is due to the fact that they are largely determined,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30
this in spite of the fact that some of the measurements,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30

the difficulties introduced by the fact that the probability law (70),the,rsta_1937_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1937,30

cavity as do the gills—a fact which Datu failed to realise—and,the,rstb_1928_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30

from the Sinusoidal Form.—In actual fact the wave of electromotive force,the,rsta_1928_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
as is shown by the fact that the series obtained by,the,rsta_1928_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
this is confirmed by the fact that for a considerable portion,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
arrangement is conditioned by the fact that in the adjusted es,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

labour is ofiset by the fact that in practice there is,the,rsta_1928_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
"of the same parameter. The fact that z,, «4, ¢ are",the,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
one had even 0-0. The fact is that the size of,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30

the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30
the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30
number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30

a formal explanation from the fact of their position in front,the,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
would be expected from the fact that their ver- tebree have,the,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

this stage lies in the fact that the trabecule have undergone,the,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

may be associated with the fact that the syrinx has superseded,the,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
and the Chelonia. This latter fact may perhaps be regarded as,the,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"of interpretation, related to the fact that the centre median nucleus",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"is made improbable by the fact that, although hernia is very",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when there is asymmetry,",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",the,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
the gases to burn. This fact has several times been conclusively,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem of,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
not the Griess tests. (The fact that the spray affected the,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
not easy to explain the fact that some fuels behave so,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
do not readily knock. The fact that the amount of nitrogen,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
will be mentioned. (1) The fact that the molybdate solution 502,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"is solely due to the fact that, in order to obtain",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"of this lies in the fact that, while a pronounced “",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

assume that they are in fact prepubertal. The testes of the,the,rstb_1936_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,in,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,in,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,in,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,in,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,in,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,in,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,in,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,in,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,in,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,in,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,in,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

to be supported by the fact that breaks in the chain,in,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This was based upon the fact that in the forms which,in,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,in,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,in,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"is solely due to the fact that, in order to obtain",in,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,in,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,in,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,in,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,in,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,in,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,in,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

this in spite of the fact that ground- up shells form,this,rstb_1928_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30

section. This example illustrates the fact that the existence of a,this,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928,30
the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30

"and it is an interesting fact that during this period also,",this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
this condition lies in the fact that the chorionic villi of,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
"for this lies in the fact that, at the lowest temperatures",this,rsta_1932_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30

on the second hyperbola. The fact that this are never closes,this,rsta_1932_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
than those in tension. This fact has been well known for,this,rsta_1932_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From,this,rsta_1932_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
others. This follows from the fact that the friction varies directly,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30

from right to left. This fact should be borne in mind,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
thickness of the membrane. This fact gives additional weight to the,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30
this is due to the fact that the solution is only,this,rsta_1933_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

attached to this feature. The fact that there is no “,this,rstb_1928_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30
to isolate it. But this fact iselfis no valid argument in,this,rstb_1928_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30
this in spite of the fact that ground- up shells form,this,rstb_1928_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1928,30

the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30
the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929,30

its early separation is the fact that this membrane is already,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
this is explained by the fact that another vesicle . .,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30

"and it is an interesting fact that during this period also,",this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
this condition lies in the fact that the chorionic villi of,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,30
"for this lies in the fact that, at the lowest temperatures",this,rsta_1932_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30

"explain on this theory another fact of observation, namely, that if",this,rsta_1932_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30

exceeds 0-46 per cent. This fact finds its explanation in the,this,rsta_1932_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30

on the second hyperbola. The fact that this are never closes,this,rsta_1932_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
than those in tension. This fact has been well known for,this,rsta_1932_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From,this,rsta_1932_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30

This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

this is due to the fact that the solution is only,this,rsta_1933_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

be the most probable. The fact that primary walls do not,be,rstb_1934_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

fixed angles of inclination. This fact may be illustrated in another,be,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
might be urged that the fact of two distinct modes of,be,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,be,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,be,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

amount. Steel A appears in fact to be more uniform in,be,rsta_1932_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From,be,rsta_1932_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
may be sought in the fact that the former is the,be,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932,30
from right to left. This fact should be borne in mind,be,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,30

and the Chelonia. This latter fact may perhaps be regarded as,be,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
be the most probable. The fact that primary walls do not,be,rstb_1934_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
be considered a peculiarity. The fact that the ventral nuclei of,be,rstb_1934_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
fixed angles of inclination. This fact may be illustrated in another,be,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
might be urged that the fact of two distinct modes of,be,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

days or more * This fact was referred to elsewhere in,to,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
it possible to relate the fact that the fibro- muscular tissue,to,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

has been drawn to the fact that these cords are to,to,rstb_1937_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
This is due to the fact that only those D cells,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

difficult to see that this fact carries any weight at all,to,rstb_1937_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

"a great distance, until in fact its ventral part came to",to,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

Of special interest is the fact that any sideward lean of,that,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
"point of view, the outstanding fact is that its ability to",that,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

might be urged that the fact of two distinct modes of,that,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

due in part to the fact that the injection mass has,that,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30
This is correlated with the fact that at this time the,that,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

may now be completed. Another fact that may be useful in,that,rsta_1934_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not sufficiently",that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
equilibrium diagrams now reveals the fact that where the alomic size,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"Callorhynchus, shows that despite the fact that the region of the",that,rstb_1935_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when there is asymmetry,",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains that it has survived",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
region. In view of the fact that this layer has not,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

Of special interest is the fact that any sideward lean of,that,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

This is correlated with the fact that at this time the,that,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,30

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

may now be completed. Another fact that may be useful in,that,rsta_1934_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not sufficiently",that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
part of the scheme; the fact that they were generated independently,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
; there is also the fact that at a speed of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

difficulty was occasioned by the fact that in this case neither,that,rsta_1934_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

"has been taken of the fact that we may omit M,,s",that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

attention once more to the fact that they do become quite,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
Orr.** In spite of the fact that its general validity remains,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
6: this follows from the fact that in general 2 cos,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
equilibrium diagrams now reveals the fact that where the alomic size,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30

segregation in spite of the fact that they were sand castings.,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,30
"Callorhynchus, shows that despite the fact that the region of the",that,rstb_1935_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",that,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,that,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",that,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,30

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
treatment with boiling water. This fact seems to indicate clearly that,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"electric field, consequent on the fact that the limit of the",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
showed the typical figure. The fact that many of these particles,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30
engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem of,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,30

probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,that,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,30
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
principles underlying the theory. The fact that I is not zero,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30
to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,30

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,30
