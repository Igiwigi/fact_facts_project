"I must emphasise, therefore, the fact that CARRUTHERS undoubtedly was correctly",that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

this expansion lies in the fact that the infinite series of,that,rsta_1918_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"however, is due to the fact that more ions are produced",that,rsta_1918_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"of the photographs, and the fact that the density so defined",that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
of these results is the fact that the central intensities for,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

to be negatived by the fact that different series behave in,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
all four salts. The main fact that these latter ratios indicate,that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
is admirably illustrated by the fact that both Sthe average and,that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"containing those elements. Moreover, the fact that both atomic weight and",that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"of the latter, beyond the fact that in some of them",that,rsta_1918_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

This is proved by the fact that the Charnian rocks were,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

account is taken of the fact that the Lough- borough and,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

BE In view of the fact that the sound-waves in the,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

this expansion lies in the fact that the infinite series of,that,rsta_1918_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"of the photographs, and the fact that the density so defined",that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
of these results is the fact that the central intensities for,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

to be negatived by the fact that different series behave in,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

is admirably illustrated by the fact that both Sthe average and,that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"and congested a structure, the fact remains that no such irregularity",that,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

discrepancy on account of the fact that G. W. WALKER has,that,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
to be found in the fact that now the stationary value,that,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
eclipse was due to the fact that experience in developing the,that,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
this must be set the fact that the five stars shown,that,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"that, in spite of the fact that all the molecules are",that,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
cohesive force lies in the fact that by it-we can readily,that,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and,that,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
first on account of the fact that it apparently involves more,that,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
number is counterbalanced by the fact that the dynamical argument ultimately,that,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
were it not for the fact that our functions are not,that,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
§ 6 agrees with the fact that the material media of,that,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
"energies are potential, but the fact that the forces on the",that,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

then best described by the fact that the action integral b,that,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

interest in view of the fact that it is in this,that,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
even taking into consideration the fact that the numbers are derived,that,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
relatively to the second. The fact that 44144 is not visible,that,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.,that,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
in order to establish the fact that the phenomenon continued to,that,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

to modifications introduced by the fact that the channel has not,that,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
it is due to the fact that the tidal wave from,that,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

explanation is found in the fact that the difference between the,that,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"the oun, combined with the fact that the corresponding oun multiple",that,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

allowance is made for this fact and the somewhat greater margin,this,rstb_1914_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

"IN PARTHENOGENESIS. 423 being in fact nz. This is to say,",this,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
This is shown by the fact that the death-rate in the,this,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
this is provided by the fact that two lines were bred,this,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

this water arises from the fact that its purity and high,this,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

has drawn attention to this fact with regard to the inheritance,this,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
forms. This is notwithstanding the fact that in having large yolky,this,rstb_1914_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
"24, fig. 30). This important fact in asterid ontogeny was first",this,rstb_1914_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
is probably related to the fact that in this species the,this,rstb_1914_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
this was found in the fact that by fitting a bell,this,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
the change of resistance. In fact this point confines the present,this,rsta_1914_0023.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
then we can use this fact to obtain an estimate of,this,rsta_1914_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
be rendered negligibly small. This fact led Mr. A. CAmpBeti* to,this,rsta_1914_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
no doubt due to this fact that we are able to,this,rsta_1914_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
This merely expresses the obvious fact that there can be no,this,rsta_1914_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
This agrees with the known fact that at tropical stations the,this,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
matter is indicated by the fact * For this suggestion we,this,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
for this ratio is in fact much more closely obeyed than,this,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

of this lies in the fact that the 1912 bolling-curve comes,this,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23

"Température Climato- logique,” considers this fact a fatal objection to Hmserpen’s",this,rstb_1916_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23

temperature and vapour pressure. This fact alone accounts for the complexity,this,rstb_1916_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
I hope to establish the fact that this parallelism holds good,this,rstb_1916_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
In this way the well-known fact of transpiration in saturated air,this,rstb_1916_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23

"from conjugating, does not this fact still further diminish the value",this,rstb_1916_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23

It is not with this fact but with its explanation that,this,rstb_1916_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
be taken of this very fact to separate impurities that are,this,rsta_1916_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1916,23

This agrees with the known fact of slight cohesion in gases.,this,rsta_1916_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1916,23
This was due to the fact that such a use of,this,rsta_1916_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1916,23

"their original relations. With this fact established, the position we have",this,rstb_1918_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

in the large flow. This fact would tend to minimise the,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23
is possibly owing to this fact that these measurements give values,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23
Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23
against this assumption is the fact that the rat which died,this,rstb_1912_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1912,23

"to this hypothesis is the fact that, hitherto, impressions of C.",this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,23
evidence is furnished from the fact that leaves of this type,this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,23

allowance is made for this fact and the somewhat greater margin,this,rstb_1914_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

"IN PARTHENOGENESIS. 423 being in fact nz. This is to say,",this,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
This is shown by the fact that the death-rate in the,this,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
this is provided by the fact that two lines were bred,this,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

is probably related to the fact that in this species the,this,rstb_1914_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
this was found in the fact that by fitting a bell,this,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

matter is indicated by the fact * For this suggestion we,this,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
for this ratio is in fact much more closely obeyed than,this,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

of this lies in the fact that the 1912 bolling-curve comes,this,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23

temperature and vapour pressure. This fact alone accounts for the complexity,this,rstb_1916_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
I hope to establish the fact that this parallelism holds good,this,rstb_1916_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
In this way the well-known fact of transpiration in saturated air,this,rstb_1916_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23

"from conjugating, does not this fact still further diminish the value",this,rstb_1916_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23

the period of repetition. The fact that the hysteresis loop is,is,rsta_1911_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23

is borne out by the fact that very few survive more,is,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,is,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

is diminished owing to the fact that differential readings of temperature,is,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is probably due to the fact that the wind was blowing,is,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
temperature is indicated by the fact that there is no further,is,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

of “castration parasitaire” is the fact that intestinal Protozoa have sb,is,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

is taken into account the fact that many animals take in,is,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

the first. It is in fact definitely reduced. This series behaves,is,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

relatively to the Diffuse series—in fact the intensity is doubled—and a,is,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
this is due to the fact that the sea is deep.,is,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"observed region, and as a fact the corresponding line is found",is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
explanation is found in the fact that the difference between the,is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
can be applied. As a fact the Ne oun is amongst,is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
obtainable by chemical methods. In fact the question is raised as,is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"to different groups, and in fact the condition is satisfied by",is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

AgPiii[IV.]. The series is in fact continued further than is shown,is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
as on the limit. In fact a similar phenomenon is indicated,is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
is supported also by the fact that there are a number,is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

and two empirical constants the fact is not very remarkable; when,the,rsta_1912_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1912,23

cause was traced to the fact that the lower surface of,the,rsta_1912_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1912,23

that the minimum is in fact in the neighbourhood of 25°,the,rsta_1912_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1912,23

may be connected with the fact that at 30° C. the,the,rsta_1912_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1912,23

"is essentially due to the fact that the excitation, in so",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding of,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
very likely account for the fact that the oxygen consumption per,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
an hour. Coupled with the fact that the alteration of the,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
is bound up with the fact that we were taking an,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23

this indirect action is the fact that the lips and faces,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23

to have arisen from the fact that some of the results,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
"the exchanger, and to the fact that the distribution of temperature",the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
formule for other elements. The fact that the series depends in,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
considerably from VS (1). This fact renders the notation of the,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
"A, is due to the fact that except for Ba A",the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

is clearly shown by the fact that the next homologue phenylethyl-carbinol,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

account is taken of the fact that the Lough- borough and,the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"the weightier metallic interchange, a fact in full keeping with the",the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

This really arose from the fact that after a large amount,the,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"theory, partly owing to the fact that the results of their",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"than the 24-hour component, a fact which has an interesting bearing",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"Even as it is, the fact that the harmonic Q,~' will",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

the interpretation of the above fact of observation seems rather to,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

BE In view of the fact that the sound-waves in the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

of discontinuity taking place. The fact that in a siren the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"pressure amplitudes, owing to the fact that in the latter case",the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
not determinate owing to the fact that the face opposite the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

This error lies in the fact that some of the air,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

following causes :— 1. The fact that the existing material usually,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

view is supported by the fact that the occipitals in the,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

of “castration parasitaire” is the fact that intestinal Protozoa have sb,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

"in maternal inheritance, despite the fact that elimination only takes place",the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

in the pure species. This fact has also been noticed by,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
has drawn attention to this fact with regard to the inheritance,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
gains further support from the fact ON THE EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION OF,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
bringing about some change. The fact that no such change took,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
may be compared with the fact that in 1912 most of,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
results at least emphasize the fact that it is necessary to,the,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

"will be comparable with the fact that, at any rate, in",the,rstb_1914_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
"before backwards. The very significant fact emerged that, on the whole,",the,rstb_1914_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

to be expected from the fact that all the lines referred,the,rsta_1914_0022.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

THE ORIGIN OF THE The fact that the negative emission from,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
may be quite inappreciable. The fact that chemical action and rise,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
is doubtless due to the fact that the emission from the,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

may be due to the fact that THRELFALL’s observations are all,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
this was found in the fact that by fitting a bell,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

the change of resistance. In fact this point confines the present,the,rsta_1914_0023.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

group is indicated by the fact that these lines occur under,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28 for,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

Attention is drawn to the fact that the higher charges are,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

sometimes shattered into pieces. The fact that no tamping is necessary,the,rsta_1914_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
explanation gains weight from the fact that at perigee the lunar,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

"“law of continuity,” and the fact that our mathematics is applied",the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
This agrees with the known fact that at tropical stations the,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

in the main from the fact already noticed in connection with,the,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
significance probably attaches to the fact that 2’s are slightly more,the,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

may be drawn to the fact that no “ smoothed curves”,the,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

"in the opposite direction. In fact it becomes 6°912000, 3471 below",the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
above points rather to the fact that we have to do,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
possibility of doing this. In fact Ryppere’s tables give the limit,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

account is taken of the fact that the Lough- borough and,the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

the interpretation of the above fact of observation seems rather to,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
first on account of the fact that it apparently involves more,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

only the restricting conditions. In fact when once these multipliers and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"and accurate, and that in fact in agreement with the results",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
on this special form. In fact it involves the definite assumption,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
for this quantity; and the fact that they all lead to,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

even taking into consideration the fact that the numbers are derived,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
relatively to the second. The fact that 44144 is not visible,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

relatively to the Diffuse series—in fact the intensity is doubled—and a,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
"the eddies, which can in fact be seen marking the surface",the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
this is due to the fact that the sea is deep.,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
"is probably due to the. fact that, at the times the",the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

explanation is found in the fact that the difference between the,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

may be due to the fact that the line taken for,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
refer to real relationship. In fact there are cases where the,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

4 is the further important fact that the potential gradient observations,is,rsta_1915_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1915,23

is in spite of the fact that our methods of investigation,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23

"rather low, aided by the fact that Giza is rather too",is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23
their first flower- buds. This fact is of primary importance in,is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23
where it is hotter. The fact that all spacings are equally,is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23

"with (44), to recall the fact that ¢ is of the",is,rsta_1915_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1915,23

breathed were vitiated by the fact that the rate of respiratory,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
"is essentially due to the fact that the excitation, in so",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding of,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
very likely account for the fact that the oxygen consumption per,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
an hour. Coupled with the fact that the alteration of the,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
is bound up with the fact that we were taking an,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23

this indirect action is the fact that the lips and faces,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23

different observers arises from the fact that they are expressed in,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
to have arisen from the fact that some of the results,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
"the exchanger, and to the fact that the distribution of temperature",the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
formule for other elements. The fact that the series depends in,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
considerably from VS (1). This fact renders the notation of the,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
"A, is due to the fact that except for Ba A",the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

This is due to the fact that the paths of the,the,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

reasonable in view of the fact that readings concordant within about,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
term is shown by the fact that whilst the concordance between,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23
is clearly shown by the fact that the next homologue phenylethyl-carbinol,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

something to do with the fact that days of large spot,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28 for,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

explanation gains weight from the fact that at perigee the lunar,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

"varies considerably, It is this fact that causes the wide differences",the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
account is taken of the fact that the Lough- borough and,the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
A difficulty arises from the fact that the central coarser portion,the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"Further, it is a well-known fact that in many areas the",the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"rocks, Secondly, there is the fact that where the Paleozoic rocks",the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
in the specimens examined. In fact the minerals in the “heathen”,the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"surface rocks, and emphasize the fact that in using the term",the,rsta_1919_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
the ambiguity arising from the fact that in this region of,the,rsta_1919_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"for different distances, and the fact that case (2) gives e",the,rsta_1919_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is in accordance with the fact that all the brighter lines,the,rsta_1919_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"potassium ferrous selenate, and the fact that even when formed the",the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"firmed several times, and the fact definitely established that the optic",the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"described have been compared, The fact that crystals of potassium ferrous",the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"warm day, together with the fact that the crystals of caesium",the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
character in the group. This fact is in complete harmony with,the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"the weightier metallic interchange, a fact in full keeping with the",the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
rubidium ferrous selenate. This striking fact of the congruency of the,the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
honour was increased by the fact that I was a pupil,the,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
be over-rated. Apart from the fact that it relieved me of,the,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
This really arose from the fact that after a large amount,the,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
neglect. It seems an unfortunate fact that the efforts of magneticians,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"theory, partly owing to the fact that the results of their",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"than the 24-hour component, a fact which has an interesting bearing",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
factor (R/r)” allows for the fact that the magnetic variations are,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"Even as it is, the fact that the harmonic Q,~' will",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
into our theoretical calculations. Another fact worth noting is that the,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
the interpretation of the above fact of observation seems rather to,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
a distance without change. This fact is well illustrated by the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is probably due to the fact that the frequency is governed,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"downwards, thus explaining the familiar fact that sound may be more",the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
BE In view of the fact that the sound-waves in the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is diminished owing to the fact that differential readings of temperature,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

to be due to the fact that conditions are so adjusted,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
of discontinuity taking place. The fact that in a siren the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"pressure amplitudes, owing to the fact that in the latter case",the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
not determinate owing to the fact that the face opposite the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is probably due to the fact that the wind was blowing,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
by [aW/af)=l8p[f(2qm). ee Expressing the fact that the entire flow of,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

This error lies in the fact that some of the air,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"in this situation, and the fact that these in many places",the,rstb_1920_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

the explanation lies in the fact that in early germs the,the,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

with the Tertiary forms.” The fact that fairly complete lineages of,the,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

also drew attention to the fact that from the Pre-Crag Dorsal,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
is necessary to emphasise the fact that the method of preparing,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
well to again emphasise the fact that these seven specimens have,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

of the author to the fact that the shape of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
IMPLEMENTS stress on the remarkable fact that the symmetry of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
material entirely depends on the fact that it is of different,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
following causes :— 1. The fact that the existing material usually,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

view is supported by the fact that the occipitals in the,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
"recognised, is shown by the fact that they are often horseshoe-shaped,",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

treatment receives justification from the fact that these various characters are,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
and workers ; (2) the fact that nymphs with well-developed wing,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
of “castration parasitaire” is the fact that intestinal Protozoa have sb,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

"and congested a structure, the fact remains that no such irregularity",the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

of this phenomenon ; in fact all the evidence shows that,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
discrepancy on account of the fact that G. W. WALKER has,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations to S, (2)",the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

this must be set the fact that the five stars shown,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"that, in spite of the fact that all the molecules are",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
"explanation of this, the following fact is significant. Scapolite cleaves parallel",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
first on account of the fact that it apparently involves more,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
number is counterbalanced by the fact that the dynamical argument ultimately,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
only the restricting conditions. In fact when once these multipliers and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"and the calculation has in fact been carried out by Larmor,*",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
"energies are potential, but the fact that the forces on the",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"and accurate, and that in fact in agreement with the results",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
on this special form. In fact it involves the definite assumption,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
for this quantity; and the fact that they all lead to,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
probably exist and are in fact of precisely the correct type.,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

even taking into consideration the fact that the numbers are derived,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
relatively to the second. The fact that 44144 is not visible,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

to be expected from the fact that all the lines referred,the,rsta_1914_0022.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
"studied it, and from the fact that second freezing-points occur along",the,rsta_1914_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

THE ORIGIN OF THE The fact that the negative emission from,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
may be quite inappreciable. The fact that chemical action and rise,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
is doubtless due to the fact that the emission from the,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
"components, on account of the fact that the epochs are changing",the,rsta_1914_0020.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

may be due to the fact that THRELFALL’s observations are all,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
this was found in the fact that by fitting a bell,the,rsta_1914_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

the change of resistance. In fact this point confines the present,the,rsta_1914_0023.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

group is indicated by the fact that these lines occur under,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28 for,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

Attention is drawn to the fact that the higher charges are,the,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

sometimes shattered into pieces. The fact that no tamping is necessary,the,rsta_1914_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
explanation gains weight from the fact that at perigee the lunar,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

"“law of continuity,” and the fact that our mathematics is applied",the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
This agrees with the known fact that at tropical stations the,the,rsta_1914_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

in the main from the fact already noticed in connection with,the,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
significance probably attaches to the fact that 2’s are slightly more,the,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

may be drawn to the fact that no “ smoothed curves”,the,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

"in the opposite direction. In fact it becomes 6°912000, 3471 below",the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
above points rather to the fact that we have to do,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23
possibility of doing this. In fact Ryppere’s tables give the limit,the,rsta_1914_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1914,23

with these estimates is the fact that by far the highest,the,rstb_1915_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23

"sympodium appears, owing to the fact that this second flower follows",the,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
This was due to the fact that the differentiation of buds,the,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

conviction in this matter. The fact that fields could be found,the,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

"extraordinarily nuclear appearance, however, the fact that in some places there",the,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
is perhaps correlated with the fact that the cones are exceedingly,the,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
? organs are recognisable. The fact that there are distinct indications,the,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

view is found in the fact that these haloes are almost,the,rsta_1918_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
by heating the mica. This fact led the earlier observers into,the,rsta_1918_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
in the Carlow mica. In fact in places the clear mica,the,rsta_1918_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"those appertaining to Q,. The fact is that any Hammond operator",the,rsta_1918_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

to point out the remarkable fact that although the chromium lines,the,rsta_1918_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

This is due to the fact that the shorter the wave-length,the,rsta_1918_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"It is, therefore, a general fact that, without exception, the energy",the,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
of these results is the fact that the central intensities for,the,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

as to spurious links. In fact the long succession of p,the,rsta_1918_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"The nearest deep boring in fact is at Orton,* about 15",the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"varies considerably, It is this fact that causes the wide differences",the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
account is taken of the fact that the Lough- borough and,the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
A difficulty arises from the fact that the central coarser portion,the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"Further, it is a well-known fact that in many areas the",the,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"for different distances, and the fact that case (2) gives e",the,rsta_1919_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is in accordance with the fact that all the brighter lines,the,rsta_1919_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"the weightier metallic interchange, a fact in full keeping with the",the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

This really arose from the fact that after a large amount,the,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"than the 24-hour component, a fact which has an interesting bearing",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"Even as it is, the fact that the harmonic Q,~' will",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
into our theoretical calculations. Another fact worth noting is that the,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
the interpretation of the above fact of observation seems rather to,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
a distance without change. This fact is well illustrated by the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is probably due to the fact that the frequency is governed,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

BE In view of the fact that the sound-waves in the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is diminished owing to the fact that differential readings of temperature,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is probably due to the fact that the wind was blowing,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

This error lies in the fact that some of the air,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

in the large flow. This fact would tend to minimise the,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23
is possibly owing to this fact that these measurements give values,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23

"to this hypothesis is the fact that, hitherto, impressions of C.",this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,23

of this lies in the fact that the 1912 bolling-curve comes,this,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23

for this quantity; and the fact that they all lead to,this,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

this is due to the fact that the sea is deep.,this,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

and as a matter of fact this series was used ‘to,this,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
This is supported by the fact that thé two lines given,this,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

the centripetal xylem is a fact which supports this suggestion; but,this,rstb_1911_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1911,23
"This is due to the fact that, in contact with air,",this,rstb_1911_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1911,23

"than one section, but this fact assists in determining their size,",this,rstb_1911_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1911,23

this may account for the fact that the latter gives off,this,rstb_1911_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1911,23

this extreme case in the fact that a short time only,this,rsta_1911_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23

Du. The proof of this fact and of various other properties,this,rsta_1911_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23
in the large flow. This fact would tend to minimise the,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23
is possibly owing to this fact that these measurements give values,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23
Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,23
against this assumption is the fact that the rat which died,this,rstb_1912_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1912,23

"to this hypothesis is the fact that, hitherto, impressions of C.",this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,23
evidence is furnished from the fact that leaves of this type,this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,23

"all the specimens, and this fact alone indicates that it had",this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,23

against this allocation is the fact that they do not lie,this,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

allowance is made for this fact and the somewhat greater margin,this,rstb_1914_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

of this lies in the fact that the 1912 bolling-curve comes,this,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915,23

"Température Climato- logique,” considers this fact a fatal objection to Hmserpen’s",this,rstb_1916_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23

temperature and vapour pressure. This fact alone accounts for the complexity,this,rstb_1916_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
I hope to establish the fact that this parallelism holds good,this,rstb_1916_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
In this way the well-known fact of transpiration in saturated air,this,rstb_1916_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
cyst are left behind. This fact was mentioned in our account,this,rstb_1916_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
"from conjugating, does not this fact still further diminish the value",this,rstb_1916_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23

It is not with this fact but with its explanation that,this,rstb_1916_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1916,23
be taken of this very fact to separate impurities that are,this,rsta_1916_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1916,23
This is due to the fact that as more wrappings are,this,rsta_1916_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1916,23

This agrees with the known fact of slight cohesion in gases.,this,rsta_1916_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1916,23
This was due to the fact that such a use of,this,rsta_1916_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1916,23

in the pure species. This fact has also been noticed by,in,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23
may be compared with the fact that in 1912 most of,in,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914,23

and is due to the fact that want of oxygen aids,of,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23

The reason lies in the fact that even the homogeneous alloys,that,rsta_1912_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1912,23

Another. It is an undoubted fact that molecules attract one another,that,rsta_1912_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1912,23
velocities after molecular collisions. The fact that this important consideration had,that,rsta_1912_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1912,23

breathed were vitiated by the fact that the rate of respiratory,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23
"is essentially due to the fact that the excitation, in so",that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23

is bound up with the fact that we were taking an,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23

"Peak, in spite of the fact that the initial oxygen pressure",that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913,23

This is due to the fact that the paths of the,that,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

"of this, combined with the fact that the inner or carbon",that,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913,23

"markedly emarginate, and in the fact that the lateral grooves, arising",that,rstb_1918_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
"these fish, and to the fact that the pellicle of the",that,rstb_1918_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
give the same information. The fact that the data refer to,that,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
misprint is shown by the fact that the total for the,that,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
1828 is due to the fact that the figures for one,that,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
"different epidemic periodicity exists, a fact that must be con- sidered",that,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
"reasoning, it follows that the fact that the epidemic period in",that,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
to be due to the fact that it is not unusual,that,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
of no account and the fact that it is lost in,that,rstb_1918_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the lines of separation,that,rstb_1918_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
is doubtless due to the fact that this prolongation cannot be,that,rstb_1918_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
is strongly suggested by the fact that it bounds on one,that,rstb_1918_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
important in view of the fact that eI the interpretation of,that,rstb_1918_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

nucleus is due to the fact that almost all the cytoplasm,that,rstb_1918_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
invisibility is due to that fact that it does not stain,that,rstb_1918_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
alone that is stained. In fact the septa have almost disappeared,that,rstb_1918_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

"the reader’s attention to the fact that these legends, though printed",that,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

"sympodium appears, owing to the fact that this second flower follows",that,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
This was due to the fact that the differentiation of buds,that,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
"average, a “late” one, the fact shows that the cause was",that,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
have been due to the fact that we were using land,that,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
conviction in this matter. The fact that fields could be found,that,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
disadvantages may be set the fact that they abolish the probable,that,rstb_1918_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
type of Bennettites cone the fact that the seeds are all,that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23

"cone, and also by the fact that they have no indication",that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
"weathering, and partly to the fact that the young, undeveloped cones",that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
"extraordinarily nuclear appearance, however, the fact that in some places there",that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
is perhaps correlated with the fact that the cones are exceedingly,that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
? organs are recognisable. The fact that there are distinct indications,that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
"I must emphasise, therefore, the fact that CARRUTHERS undoubtedly was correctly",that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918,23
view is found in the fact that these haloes are almost,that,rsta_1918_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"given, on account of the fact that the correction for the",that,rsta_1918_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"those appertaining to Q,. The fact is that any Hammond operator",that,rsta_1918_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
be zero. Finally the important fact emerged that the performance of,that,rsta_1918_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
this expansion lies in the fact that the infinite series of,that,rsta_1918_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
was discarded owing to the fact that iron is a plentiful,that,rsta_1918_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
to point out the remarkable fact that although the chromium lines,that,rsta_1918_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
This is due to the fact that chromium is absent from,that,rsta_1918_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
abundance than nickel. To this fact must be added that of,that,rsta_1918_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
are left owing to the fact that the entries pease “,that,rsta_1918_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
are left owing to the fact that the entries would be,that,rsta_1918_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"however, is due to the fact that more ions are produced",that,rsta_1918_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
This is due to the fact that the shorter the wave-length,that,rsta_1918_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
simplest form Bowing to the fact that over the short range,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"of the photographs, and the fact that the density so defined",that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
of these results is the fact that the central intensities for,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
difference can be detected. The fact that their “absolute” heights were,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
to be negatived by the fact that different series behave in,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
all four salts. The main fact that these latter ratios indicate,that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
is admirably illustrated by the fact that both Sthe average and,that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"containing those elements. Moreover, the fact that both atomic weight and",that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"of the latter, beyond the fact that in some of them",that,rsta_1918_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
other evidence is available. The fact that the vast majority of,that,rsta_1918_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
possibly be due to the fact that the separations are due,that,rsta_1918_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
is doubtless due to the fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1918_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"gases, but owing to the fact that there are three variables",that,rsta_1918_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
may be gained from the fact that for a simple gas,that,rsta_1918_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
"obviously follows from the mere fact that we treat Ev, as",that,rsta_1919_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
seem to point to the fact that the liquefied solutes have,that,rsta_1919_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
that good results can in fact be attained by treating the,that,rsta_1919_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"602 and 626. + The fact that there exist substances, as,",that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
was greatly facilitated by the fact that the whole area had,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
should be laid upon the fact that samples cut from the,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
This is proved by the fact that the Charnian rocks were,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
rocks are explained by the fact that in such rocks the,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"varies considerably, It is this fact that causes the wide differences",that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
account is taken of the fact that the Lough- borough and,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
A difficulty arises from the fact that the central coarser portion,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"Further, it is a well-known fact that in many areas the",that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"surface rocks, and emphasize the fact that in using the term",that,rsta_1919_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
the ambiguity arising from the fact that in this region of,that,rsta_1919_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"for different distances, and the fact that case (2) gives e",that,rsta_1919_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is in accordance with the fact that all the brighter lines,that,rsta_1919_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"potassium ferrous selenate, and the fact that even when formed the",that,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

honour was increased by the fact that I was a pupil,that,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
be over-rated. Apart from the fact that it relieved me of,that,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
This really arose from the fact that after a large amount,that,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
neglect. It seems an unfortunate fact that the efforts of magneticians,that,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"theory, partly owing to the fact that the results of their",that,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"Even as it is, the fact that the harmonic Q,~' will",that,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
into our theoretical calculations. Another fact worth noting is that the,that,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is probably due to the fact that the frequency is governed,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"downwards, thus explaining the familiar fact that sound may be more",that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
BE In view of the fact that the sound-waves in the,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is diminished owing to the fact that differential readings of temperature,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
valve thermometer owing to the fact that the former was more,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
to be due to the fact that conditions are so adjusted,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
of discontinuity taking place. The fact that in a siren the,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
"pressure amplitudes, owing to the fact that in the latter case",that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
not determinate owing to the fact that the face opposite the,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
is probably due to the fact that the wind was blowing,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
by [aW/af)=l8p[f(2qm). ee Expressing the fact that the entire flow of,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
temperature is indicated by the fact that there is no further,that,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
This error lies in the fact that some of the air,that,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23
safeguard is provided by the fact that in experiments where there,that,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

large error owing to the fact that the connecting tubes (and,that,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919,23

"in this situation, and the fact that these in many places",that,rstb_1920_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

the explanation lies in the fact that in early germs the,that,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
he drew attention to the fact that specimens of Nasmyth’s Membrane,that,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
"may be recognised by the fact that the forms are small,",that,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
with the Tertiary forms.” The fact that fairly complete lineages of,that,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

also drew attention to the fact that from the Pre-Crag Dorsal,that,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

IMPLEMENTS stress on the remarkable fact that the symmetry of the,that,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
material entirely depends on the fact that it is of different,that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
following causes :— 1. The fact that the existing material usually,that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
skull mentioned differing in the fact that the frontal is shown,that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
"distinct from, Eryops. From the fact that the majority of the",that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

"OF THE AMPHIBIA. 45 the fact that it might conceivably, though",that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
of the quadrate. 5. The fact that the occipital condyles lie,that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
the Embolomeri depend on the fact that the Recieee are derived,that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23
Connected with it is the fact that whilst in Eryops the,that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

"the parallel, but from the fact that the structures whose independent",that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

view is afforded by the fact that narrow clavicles are very,that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

"appearance, is obvious from the fact that they are present on",that,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

this expansion lies in the fact that the infinite series of,that,rsta_1918_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

"of the photographs, and the fact that the density so defined",that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23
of these results is the fact that the central intensities for,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

is admirably illustrated by the fact that both Sthe average and,that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918,23

the Embolomeri depend on the fact that the Recieee are derived,that,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920,23

to be found in the fact that now the stationary value,that,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

"that, in spite of the fact that all the molecules are",that,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.,that,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
in order to establish the fact that the phenomenon continued to,that,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23

to modifications introduced by the fact that the channel has not,that,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
it is due to the fact that the tidal wave from,that,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920,23
