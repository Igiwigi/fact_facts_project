circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,in,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,in,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,in,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,is,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"a decisive opinion. But. the fact that the ellipticity, to whatever",the,rstl_1843_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,the,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
is the still more striking fact that alkalized water (2092.) having,the,rstl_1843_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

In no instance has the fact been better exem- plified in,the,rstl_1844_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11

The most im- portant additional fact which we derive from the,the,rstl_1844_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11

is the generalization of the fact of the proper current of,the,rstl_1845_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1845,11
for me to extend this fact to its operation upon the,the,rstl_1845_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1845,11

my numerous experiments : the fact of induced contractions is certainly,the,rstl_1845_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1845,11

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11
3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11
"comparative anatomist, from the remarkable fact that it takes place in",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,the,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
is the still more striking fact that alkalized water (2092.) having,the,rstl_1843_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

In no instance has the fact been better exem- plified in,the,rstl_1844_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11

The most im- portant additional fact which we derive from the,the,rstl_1844_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11
