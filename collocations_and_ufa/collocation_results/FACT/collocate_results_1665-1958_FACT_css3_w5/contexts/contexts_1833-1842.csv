"it accords perfectly with the fact (Plate VI. fig. 114.), that",the,rstl_1839_0021.txt,txt_rstl,1839
have now to mention a fact or two regarding the nature,the,rstl_1839_0021.txt,txt_rstl,1839
(par. 124. 299.) ? 'The fact that the germinal spot becomes,the,rstl_1839_0021.txt,txt_rstl,1839
"Dick has observed, and the fact is very important, that the",the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
Laupsr endeayours to explain this fact by supposing that when the,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839

less grandeur and symmetry. The fact of their occurrence at these,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
it is viewed. Of this fact the shelves on the south-east,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
"of this great valley, —a fact somewhat analogous to the coincidence",the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
"the case by MaccvLLocn, the fact would be highly satisfactory on",the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
obseryed the same kind of fact strikingly illustrated in Norway#. It,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
and more especially the remarkable fact of the exact coincidence of,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
strongest argument being the ascertained fact of the land rising at,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
"point with certainty. If the fact be 80, and I scarcely",the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"in cartilage, follows from the fact that the cell-nuclei do not",the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840

presented to the iodine. This fact will render obvious the superiority,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840
The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840
entire. But let not this fact militate against our conelusions. The,the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"respiration continued, I established the fact that there was a source",the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840
when compared with the remarkable fact which we shall find given,the,rstl_1840_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1840
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840
It is a well known fact that the voltaic current will,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840

at once removed by the fact of a spark of the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840
ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840
sections ; and the one fact is strikingly confirmatory of the,the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840
demonstrated. This depends on the fact that its contents swell considerably,the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840
hitherto hesitated to announce. The fact to which I allude is,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840
to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841

twelve columns we do in fact combine the intensities from all,the,rstl_1841_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1841
the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841
3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841
"comparative anatomist, from the remarkable fact that it takes place in",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841

of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841

by some authors? The above fact would seem to indicate that,the,rstl_1834_0026.txt,txt_rstl,1834

obseryed the same kind of fact strikingly illustrated in Norway#. It,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
and more especially the remarkable fact of the exact coincidence of,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
strongest argument being the ascertained fact of the land rising at,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840

The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840

"respiration continued, I established the fact that there was a source",the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840
when compared with the remarkable fact which we shall find given,the,rstl_1840_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1840
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840

this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841
3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841
"comparative anatomist, from the remarkable fact that it takes place in",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841

of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841

it is viewed. Of this fact the shelves on the south-east,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
"of this great valley, —a fact somewhat analogous to the coincidence",the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839

obseryed the same kind of fact strikingly illustrated in Norway#. It,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
and more especially the remarkable fact of the exact coincidence of,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839
strongest argument being the ascertained fact of the land rising at,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"in cartilage, follows from the fact that the cell-nuclei do not",the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840

presented to the iodine. This fact will render obvious the superiority,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840
The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840

"respiration continued, I established the fact that there was a source",the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840
when compared with the remarkable fact which we shall find given,the,rstl_1840_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1840
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840

this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840
"to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840

"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841
3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841
"comparative anatomist, from the remarkable fact that it takes place in",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841

of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841

this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,of,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841
3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these,of,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841

but a knowledge of one fact may be of service in,of,rstl_1833_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1833
of that influence. In another fact we find an additional objection,of,rstl_1833_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1833
