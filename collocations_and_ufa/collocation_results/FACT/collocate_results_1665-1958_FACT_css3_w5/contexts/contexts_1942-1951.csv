to my argument. The relevant fact is that the dorsal series,that,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947

is borne out by the fact that their theoretical threshold of,that,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
failure of pupal emergence. The fact that the larvae of X.,that,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
is borne out by the fact that there was a very,that,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
due to this cause. The fact that in both these species,that,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949

in this connexion is the fact that the siphons cannot completely,that,rstb_1949_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1949

(50) that + is in fact also given in the pulse,that,rsta_1949_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1949
of the dose and the fact that over a wide range,that,rsta_1949_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1949

reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
theory is due to the fact that perfect axial symmetry is,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
no variation rests on the fact that it is in the,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

may be drawn to the fact that in many of the,that,rsta_1949_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1949
must be laid on the fact that for the transitions discussed,that,rsta_1949_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1949

main discrepancies arise from the fact that my values were based,that,rsta_1949_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1949
in general follows from the fact that any Mach line that,that,rsta_1949_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1949
argument is based on the fact that the shockwave equations imply,that,rsta_1949_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1949
development; so there can in fact be little doubt that the,that,rstb_1950_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1950
conceivably be due to the fact that presumptive side-plate OF PRIMITIVE,that,rstb_1950_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1950

conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place among,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

clusion is drawn from the fact that the same imaginal disks,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

that these trees were in fact growing either in Cornwall or,that,rstb_1950_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1950
to this paper to the fact that the original claims made,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
to be due to the fact that the statements of Broom,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
more than point to the fact that in their metrical attributes,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
this may be added the fact that some investigators have rejected,that,rstb_1950_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1950
especially in view of the fact that it is the subject,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the lumen in the,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950

which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"due, in part, to the fact that its larvae are much",that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"take place. Apart from the fact that these occasions do arise,",that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950

was attributed to ey the fact that the echoes were very,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the long-period pendulums and the fact that their knife edges are,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

for the observed anomalies. The fact that even larger anomalies are,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

be attributed merely to the fact that the wind is stronger,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
was partly due to the fact that although all the locusts,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

by such direct responses. The fact that the observed responses to,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
took no account of the fact that the retinal velocity experienced,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"This is evident from the fact that when migration is slackening,",that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
can be attributed to the fact that the ‘maximum compensatory height’,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

present treatment lies in the fact that no complications arise when,that,rsta_1951_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1951
THOMAS accounts also for the fact that the agreement between theory,that,rsta_1951_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1951

use is limited by the fact that the small local variations,that,rsta_1951_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1951

in this connexion is the fact that the siphons cannot completely,that,rstb_1949_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1949

reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
theory is due to the fact that perfect axial symmetry is,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
no variation rests on the fact that it is in the,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

may be drawn to the fact that in many of the,that,rsta_1949_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1949
must be laid on the fact that for the transitions discussed,that,rsta_1949_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1949

main discrepancies arise from the fact that my values were based,that,rsta_1949_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1949
in general follows from the fact that any Mach line that,that,rsta_1949_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1949
argument is based on the fact that the shockwave equations imply,that,rsta_1949_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1949
development; so there can in fact be little doubt that the,that,rstb_1950_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1950

conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place among,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

clusion is drawn from the fact that the same imaginal disks,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

to this paper to the fact that the original claims made,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
to be due to the fact that the statements of Broom,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
more than point to the fact that in their metrical attributes,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
this may be added the fact that some investigators have rejected,that,rstb_1950_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1950
especially in view of the fact that it is the subject,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the lumen in the,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950

which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"due, in part, to the fact that its larvae are much",that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"take place. Apart from the fact that these occasions do arise,",that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
subdivisions is also involved. The fact that the structural results of,that,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"that (3) then has in fact infinitely many solutions. Further, by",that,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950

This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

The only relevant geo- logical fact is that the islands have,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

for the observed anomalies. The fact that even larger anomalies are,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

by such direct responses. The fact that the observed responses to,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

to this point is the fact that Yeddanapalli & Schubert themselves,this,rsta_1949_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1949

reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,this,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
"projector, and this will in fact be the period when the",this,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

to this paper to the fact that the original claims made,this,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
this may be added the fact that some investigators have rejected,this,rstb_1950_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"tracts of country, but this fact does not provide the full",this,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950

This is confirmed by the fact that the break- down potentials,this,rsta_1951_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1951

X. brasiliensis (figure 3). This fact contra- dicts the assumption of,this,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
did not develop successfully. The fact that the larvae of this,this,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
by this low temperature. The fact that the percentage of ultimate,this,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
due to this cause. The fact that in both these species,this,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
This is due to the fact that the thresholds of their,this,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
in this connexion is the fact that the siphons cannot completely,this,rstb_1949_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1949

to the ground level. This fact may havea considerable influence on,this,rsta_1949_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1949
to this point is the fact that Yeddanapalli & Schubert themselves,this,rsta_1949_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1949
order. This corresponds to the fact that with plane waves for,this,rsta_1949_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1949
reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,this,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
"projector, and this will in fact be the period when the",this,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

for E. nigrum may in fact refer to this species: it,this,rstb_1950_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1950
been computed corresponds. This latter fact may be noted in relation,this,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
to this paper to the fact that the original claims made,this,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
this may be added the fact that some investigators have rejected,this,rstb_1950_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"tracts of country, but this fact does not provide the full",this,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950

The reason lies in the fact that in this example neglected,this,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,this,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

by this method reveals the fact that a proportion of the,this,rstb_1951_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1951

This is confirmed by the fact that the break- down potentials,this,rsta_1951_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1951

This is due to the fact that whereas an acoustic shock-wave,this,rsta_1951_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1951

That the eye is in fact corrected for colour. () That,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
difference is associated with the fact that in the observer’s left,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
a very unusual manner. The fact that this observer is normal-sighted,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
proves that resolution is in fact taking place when there are,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

remarkable in view of the fact that Cetorhinus is almost certainly,is,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950
which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"presumption is justified by the fact that, in both cases, the",is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
subdivisions is also involved. The fact that the structural results of,is,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"septum, it is a striking fact that the distribution of nuclei",is,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"equation (15-4) lies in the fact that C/A, is usually small.",is,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
case is due to the fact that the reduction in B,is,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the former comes from the fact that the residual is only,is,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
and the relaxation is in fact quite easy and much more,is,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
The only relevant geo- logical fact is that the islands have,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the rising convection current. The fact that no such activity is,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
is made difficult by the fact that the relation between capillary,is,rsta_1950_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"circular, and neither is the fact in our solutions.) On that",is,rsta_1950_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"doing more arithmetic, yet in fact he is usually content with",is,rsta_1950_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1950
is in agreement with the fact that two differential equations govern,is,rsta_1950_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1950
much different from unity. The fact that there is considerable correlation,is,rsta_1950_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1950

any particular leaf is in fact exactly superposed by some other,is,rstb_1951_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1951
angle must derive from the fact that a new primordium is,is,rstb_1951_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1951
be attributed merely to the fact that the wind is stronger,is,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",is,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

That the eye is in fact corrected for colour. () That,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
difference is associated with the fact that in the observer’s left,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
a very unusual manner. The fact that this observer is normal-sighted,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
proves that resolution is in fact taking place when there are,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

second uncertainty arises from the fact that the radon is not,is,rsta_1949_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1949

reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,is,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"presumption is justified by the fact that, in both cases, the",is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"equation (15-4) lies in the fact that C/A, is usually small.",is,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
case is due to the fact that the reduction in B,is,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the former comes from the fact that the residual is only,is,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
and the relaxation is in fact quite easy and much more,is,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
The only relevant geo- logical fact is that the islands have,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the rising convection current. The fact that no such activity is,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
is made difficult by the fact that the relation between capillary,is,rsta_1950_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"circular, and neither is the fact in our solutions.) On that",is,rsta_1950_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"doing more arithmetic, yet in fact he is usually content with",is,rsta_1950_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1950

much different from unity. The fact that there is considerable correlation,is,rsta_1950_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1950

any particular leaf is in fact exactly superposed by some other,is,rstb_1951_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",is,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

One striking though hardly surprising fact is that nearly all the,is,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947

That the eye is in fact corrected for colour. () That,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
difference is associated with the fact that in the observer’s left,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
a very unusual manner. The fact that this observer is normal-sighted,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
proves that resolution is in fact taking place when there are,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

not necessary to emphasize the fact that there is evidence of,is,rstb_1948_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1948
evidence is of course the fact that Cladium peat is developed,is,rstb_1948_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1948

view is supported by the fact that the Leptothrix 5 form,is,rstb_1949_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1949

reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,is,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
theory is due to the fact that perfect axial symmetry is,is,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
"couple is due to the fact that, because of the lateral",is,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place among,is,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"is also indicated by the fact that, in the present series,",is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"presumption is justified by the fact that, in both cases, the",is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
subdivisions is also involved. The fact that the structural results of,is,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"septum, it is a striking fact that the distribution of nuclei",is,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"also be deduced, using the fact that (1, 1, 1) is",is,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"equation (15-4) lies in the fact that C/A, is usually small.",is,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
case is due to the fact that the reduction in B,is,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the former comes from the fact that the residual is only,is,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
and the relaxation is in fact quite easy and much more,is,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
The only relevant geo- logical fact is that the islands have,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the rising convection current. The fact that no such activity is,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
is made difficult by the fact that the relation between capillary,is,rsta_1950_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"circular, and neither is the fact in our solutions.) On that",is,rsta_1950_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1950
say. As a matter of fact this is a very bad,is,rsta_1950_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"doing more arithmetic, yet in fact he is usually content with",is,rsta_1950_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1950
is in agreement with the fact that two differential equations govern,is,rsta_1950_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1950
much different from unity. The fact that there is considerable correlation,is,rsta_1950_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1950

any particular leaf is in fact exactly superposed by some other,is,rstb_1951_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",is,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"region, and (ii) in the fact that polycycly is not exclusively",is,rstb_1947_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1947
One striking though hardly surprising fact is that nearly all the,is,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
attack is due to the fact that the anaesthesia necessary for,is,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947

That this is what in fact occurs soon became evident from,is,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947
to my argument. The relevant fact is that the dorsal series,is,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947

That the eye is in fact corrected for colour. () That,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
difference is associated with the fact that in the observer’s left,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
a very unusual manner. The fact that this observer is normal-sighted,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
proves that resolution is in fact taking place when there are,is,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

not necessary to emphasize the fact that there is evidence of,is,rstb_1948_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1948
evidence is of course the fact that Cladium peat is developed,is,rstb_1948_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1948
which is supported by the fact that under certain circumstances it,is,rstb_1948_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1948

from these formulae is in fact greater than the true cross-section,is,rsta_1948_0022.txt,txt_rsta,1948

reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,is,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
theory is due to the fact that perfect axial symmetry is,is,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place among,is,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"presumption is justified by the fact that, in both cases, the",is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a,is,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
subdivisions is also involved. The fact that the structural results of,is,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"septum, it is a striking fact that the distribution of nuclei",is,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"also be deduced, using the fact that (1, 1, 1) is",is,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950
equivalent. This follows from the fact that the field is galoisian,is,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"the inequality (104) is in fact isolated, if the above possi-",is,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"equation (15-4) lies in the fact that C/A, is usually small.",is,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
case is due to the fact that the reduction in B,is,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the former comes from the fact that the residual is only,is,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
and the relaxation is in fact quite easy and much more,is,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
The only relevant geo- logical fact is that the islands have,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the rising convection current. The fact that no such activity is,is,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
is made difficult by the fact that the relation between capillary,is,rsta_1950_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"circular, and neither is the fact in our solutions.) On that",is,rsta_1950_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1950
say. As a matter of fact this is a very bad,is,rsta_1950_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"doing more arithmetic, yet in fact he is usually content with",is,rsta_1950_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1950
is in agreement with the fact that two differential equations govern,is,rsta_1950_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1950
much different from unity. The fact that there is considerable correlation,is,rsta_1950_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1950

One striking though hardly surprising fact is that nearly all the,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947

already given and from the fact that the number of positive,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
explanation was shown by the fact that in five later experiments,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
is rendered doubtful by the fact that out of four control,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
accounted for satisfactorily by the fact that the earlier work was,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
counting fine unmyelinated fibres. The fact that other hypothalamic nuclei probably,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
"forms and lies in the fact that in the armadillo, manatee,",the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947

any physiological significance underlying the fact that the rabbit possesses a,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947

so is clear from the fact that the two plates are,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947
lower down the plate. This fact would make it impossible for,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947
to my argument. The relevant fact is that the dorsal series,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947

"therefore take it from this fact alone that the blood, squeezed",the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947

how can we explain the fact that the visual acuity of,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
through the eyeball discloses the fact that there is no structure,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

"The phenomenon of irradiation The fact has long been known that,",the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
a very unusual manner. The fact that this observer is normal-sighted,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
of stereoscopy lies in the fact that it operates for objects,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
to the nearer object. This fact may be stated in another,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
was apparently justified by the fact that the visual limits found,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

Leaving out of account the fact that the green fixation point,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

The figure also records the fact that the scales are bristle-like,the,rstb_1949_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1949

also borne out by the fact that at 80% R.H. with,the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949

also borne out by the fact that the initial moisture of,the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949

in this connexion is the fact that the siphons cannot completely,the,rstb_1949_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1949

to this point is the fact that Yeddanapalli & Schubert themselves,the,rsta_1949_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1949

(50) that + is in fact also given in the pulse,the,rsta_1949_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1949
of the dose and the fact that over a wide range,the,rsta_1949_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1949

for the observed anomalies. The fact that even larger anomalies are,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

be attributed merely to the fact that the wind is stronger,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
was partly due to the fact that although all the locusts,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
reactions to wind were in fact reactions to the apparent movement,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

be attributed to the mere fact that they took longer to,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"height for mosquitoes seem in fact too low, for the writer",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
is quite unconnected with the fact that wind speed generally increases,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
for swarm migration. But the fact remains that Volkonsky (1939) found,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"were it not for the fact that mass departure starts, as",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
suggests the locusts are in fact at the mercy of strong,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
scale. Such behaviour is in fact well known: the tendency of,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
no way extreme. But the fact is that such behaviour is,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
migrant is not only the fact that they remain in roughly,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"This is evident from the fact that when migration is slackening,",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
direct dependence which it in fact expresses. The tendency to go,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
can be attributed to the fact that the ‘maximum compensatory height’,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
behaviour. This theory overlooks the fact that insect-wind relations already provide,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
suggested rectifying processes are in fact responsible for the migration trends,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

of the organism is in fact only obtained when its relation,the,rstb_1949_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1949

"the outset. Nevertheless, the evident fact is that the leaves in",the,rstb_1949_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1949
confirmation was obtained of the fact that the very young primordium,the,rstb_1949_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1949

The figure also records the fact that the scales are bristle-like,the,rstb_1949_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1949
This is shown by the fact that in order to compensate,the,rstb_1949_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1949
may be connected with the fact that a birefringent substance will,the,rstb_1949_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1949

also borne out by the fact that the initial moisture of,the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949

in this connexion is the fact that the siphons cannot completely,the,rstb_1949_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1949

is in accordance with the fact that at low pressures zinc,the,rsta_1949_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1949

"those of the spermathecae, a fact confirmed by the very young",the,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

for the observed anomalies. The fact that even larger anomalies are,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

was partly due to the fact that although all the locusts,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
reactions to wind were in fact reactions to the apparent movement,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"height for mosquitoes seem in fact too low, for the writer",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
is quite unconnected with the fact that wind speed generally increases,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
for swarm migration. But the fact remains that Volkonsky (1939) found,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"were it not for the fact that mass departure starts, as",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
suggests the locusts are in fact at the mercy of strong,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
scale. Such behaviour is in fact well known: the tendency of,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

migrant is not only the fact that they remain in roughly,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"This is evident from the fact that when migration is slackening,",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
direct dependence which it in fact expresses. The tendency to go,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
can be attributed to the fact that the ‘maximum compensatory height’,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"the outset. Nevertheless, the evident fact is that the leaves in",the,rstb_1949_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1949
confirmation was obtained of the fact that the very young primordium,the,rstb_1949_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1949
at the apex; (6) the fact that when the apex is,the,rstb_1949_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1949
in the shoot. From the fact that leaf primordia arise on,the,rstb_1949_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1949

The figure also records the fact that the scales are bristle-like,the,rstb_1949_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1949

may be connected with the fact that a birefringent substance will,the,rstb_1949_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1949

also borne out by the fact that at 80% R.H. with,the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949

from the pupal skins. The fact that a fairly high percentage,the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949

also borne out by the fact that the initial moisture of,the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949

also borne out by the fact that a much higher percentage,the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
"(Uvarov 1931, p. 12). The fact that these stages cannot survive",the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949
is borne out by the fact that their theoretical threshold of,the,rstb_1949_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1949

in this connexion is the fact that the siphons cannot completely,the,rstb_1949_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1949

is in accordance with the fact that at low pressures zinc,the,rsta_1949_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1949

of the dose and the fact that over a wide range,the,rsta_1949_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1949

"those of the spermathecae, a fact confirmed by the very young",the,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950
conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place among,the,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

for the observed anomalies. The fact that even larger anomalies are,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

was partly due to the fact that although all the locusts,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
reactions to wind were in fact reactions to the apparent movement,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"height for mosquitoes seem in fact too low, for the writer",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
is quite unconnected with the fact that wind speed generally increases,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
for swarm migration. But the fact remains that Volkonsky (1939) found,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"were it not for the fact that mass departure starts, as",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
suggests the locusts are in fact at the mercy of strong,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
scale. Such behaviour is in fact well known: the tendency of,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
no way extreme. But the fact is that such behaviour is,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
migrant is not only the fact that they remain in roughly,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"This is evident from the fact that when migration is slackening,",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
direct dependence which it in fact expresses. The tendency to go,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
can be attributed to the fact that the ‘maximum compensatory height’,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
behaviour. This theory overlooks the fact that insect-wind relations already provide,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

One striking though hardly surprising fact is that nearly all the,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
attack is due to the fact that the anaesthesia necessary for,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
already given and from the fact that the number of positive,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
explanation was shown by the fact that in five later experiments,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
is rendered doubtful by the fact that out of four control,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
accounted for satisfactorily by the fact that the earlier work was,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
counting fine unmyelinated fibres. The fact that other hypothalamic nuclei probably,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
"forms and lies in the fact that in the armadillo, manatee,",the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947

any physiological significance underlying the fact that the rabbit possesses a,the,rstb_1947_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1947
"through the shell apertures, a fact noted by all who have",the,rstb_1947_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1947
so is clear from the fact that the two plates are,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947
lower down the plate. This fact would make it impossible for,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947
to my argument. The relevant fact is that the dorsal series,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947

rigid skeletal plates and the fact that they all end on,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947
space. That it does in fact take the former route is,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947
"therefore take it from this fact alone that the blood, squeezed",the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947
"the blood parenchyma does in fact pass right through it, I",the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947

with this view is the fact that the coronal nerve can,the,rstb_1947_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1947

how can we explain the fact that the visual acuity of,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
through the eyeball discloses the fact that there is no structure,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

difference is associated with the fact that in the observer’s left,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

"The phenomenon of irradiation The fact has long been known that,",the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
a very unusual manner. The fact that this observer is normal-sighted,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
of stereoscopy lies in the fact that it operates for objects,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
to the nearer object. This fact may be stated in another,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
was apparently justified by the fact that the visual limits found,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947
"the pupil diameter was in fact the limiting factor, then acuity",the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

Leaving out of account the fact that the green fixation point,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

become altered into dominators. The fact that the latter were found,the,rstb_1947_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1947

"have been used, but the fact that these must operate electrical",the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

The only relevant geo- logical fact is that the islands have,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the rising convection current. The fact that no such activity is,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
for the observed anomalies. The fact that even larger anomalies are,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
therefore seems quite normal. The fact that almost twice as great,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
can be obtained from the fact that two semi-infinite horizontal layers,the,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

second abnormality arises from the fact that inside the pipe ordinary,the,rsta_1950_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1950

be attributed merely to the fact that the wind is stronger,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
was partly due to the fact that although all the locusts,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

by such direct responses. The fact that the observed responses to,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
reactions to wind were in fact reactions to the apparent movement,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

be attributed to the mere fact that they took longer to,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"height for mosquitoes seem in fact too low, for the writer",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
is quite unconnected with the fact that wind speed generally increases,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
for swarm migration. But the fact remains that Volkonsky (1939) found,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"were it not for the fact that mass departure starts, as",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
suggests the locusts are in fact at the mercy of strong,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
scale. Such behaviour is in fact well known: the tendency of,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
no way extreme. But the fact is that such behaviour is,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
migrant is not only the fact that they remain in roughly,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"This is evident from the fact that when migration is slackening,",the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
direct dependence which it in fact expresses. The tendency to go,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
can be attributed to the fact that the ‘maximum compensatory height’,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
behaviour. This theory overlooks the fact that insect-wind relations already provide,the,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
theory is due to the fact that perfect axial symmetry is,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
no variation rests on the fact that it is in the,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

may be drawn to the fact that in many of the,that,rsta_1949_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1949
must be laid on the fact that for the transitions discussed,that,rsta_1949_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1949

main discrepancies arise from the fact that my values were based,that,rsta_1949_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1949
in general follows from the fact that any Mach line that,that,rsta_1949_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1949
argument is based on the fact that the shockwave equations imply,that,rsta_1949_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1949
development; so there can in fact be little doubt that the,that,rstb_1950_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1950

conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place among,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

clusion is drawn from the fact that the same imaginal disks,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

to this paper to the fact that the original claims made,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
to be due to the fact that the statements of Broom,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
more than point to the fact that in their metrical attributes,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
this may be added the fact that some investigators have rejected,that,rstb_1950_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1950
especially in view of the fact that it is the subject,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the lumen in the,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950

which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"due, in part, to the fact that its larvae are much",that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"take place. Apart from the fact that these occasions do arise,",that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
subdivisions is also involved. The fact that the structural results of,that,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"that (3) then has in fact infinitely many solutions. Further, by",that,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950

may be ascribed to the fact that the Liiders lines vary,that,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950

particularly in view of the fact that this test was carried,that,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"second, in spite of the fact that a more accurate derivative",that,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950

was attributed to ey the fact that the echoes were very,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
amplitude but also for the fact that individual peaks are neither,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the long-period pendulums and the fact that their knife edges are,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

for the observed anomalies. The fact that even larger anomalies are,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

be attributed merely to the fact that the wind is stronger,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
was partly due to the fact that although all the locusts,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

by such direct responses. The fact that the observed responses to,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
took no account of the fact that the retinal velocity experienced,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951
"pattern is resolvable, is in fact suggested by the observations that",that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"This is evident from the fact that when migration is slackening,",that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
theory is due to the fact that perfect axial symmetry is,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
no variation rests on the fact that it is in the,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949
differentiation that it is in fact the general solution of the,that,rsta_1949_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1949

may be drawn to the fact that in many of the,that,rsta_1949_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1949
must be laid on the fact that for the transitions discussed,that,rsta_1949_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1949

main discrepancies arise from the fact that my values were based,that,rsta_1949_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1949
in general follows from the fact that any Mach line that,that,rsta_1949_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1949
argument is based on the fact that the shockwave equations imply,that,rsta_1949_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1949
development; so there can in fact be little doubt that the,that,rstb_1950_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1950

join at its sides. This fact suggests that the cells at,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950
conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place among,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950
spermathecal duct. Owing to the fact that the duct is surrounded,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950
clusion is drawn from the fact that the same imaginal disks,that,rstb_1950_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1950

that these trees were in fact growing either in Cornwall or,that,rstb_1950_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1950
to this paper to the fact that the original claims made,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
to be due to the fact that the statements of Broom,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
more than point to the fact that in their metrical attributes,that,rstb_1950_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1950
this may be added the fact that some investigators have rejected,that,rstb_1950_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1950
especially in view of the fact that it is the subject,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the lumen in the,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950

remarkable in view of the fact that Cetorhinus is almost certainly,that,rstb_1950_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"the adult, owing to the fact that the fused petrosal and",that,rstb_1950_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1950
are not immediately concerned. The fact remains that the flies in,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"due, in part, to the fact that its larvae are much",that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"take place. Apart from the fact that these occasions do arise,",that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a,that,rstb_1950_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1950
subdivisions is also involved. The fact that the structural results of,that,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"already called attention to the fact that nuclei, other than those",that,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950

"hr., in spite of the fact that lung volume has increased,",that,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950
can it account for the fact that the structure of a,that,rstb_1950_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1950
"that (3) then has in fact infinitely many solutions. Further, by",that,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"Also, from (123) and the fact that o’ = ¢-’, where",that,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950
proving this; but possibly the fact that theorem 13 indicates the,that,rsta_1950_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1950
may be ascribed to the fact that the Liiders lines vary,that,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
would be expected from the fact that each value has a,that,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"pure bending, owing to the fact that with a central concentrated",that,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
case is due to the fact that the reduction in B,that,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950
particularly in view of the fact that this test was carried,that,rsta_1950_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"second, in spite of the fact that a more accurate derivative",that,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
The reason lies in the fact that in this example neglected,that,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"real, and arise from the fact that these equations, particularly when",that,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the former comes from the fact that the residual is only,that,rsta_1950_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1950
outstanding problems of geology. The fact that the rocks which form,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
"have been used, but the fact that these must operate electrical",that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
was attributed to ey the fact that the echoes were very,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
amplitude but also for the fact that individual peaks are neither,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the long-period pendulums and the fact that their knife edges are,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
bottom of a valley. The fact that many of these appear,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
+s results with the observed fact that areas where sediment has,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
a simple explanation of the fact that the sediments which form,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

The only relevant geo- logical fact is that the islands have,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
the rising convection current. The fact that no such activity is,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
for the observed anomalies. The fact that even larger anomalies are,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
therefore seems quite normal. The fact that almost twice as great,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950
can be obtained from the fact that two semi-infinite horizontal layers,that,rsta_1950_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1950

"(equation (127)), follows from the fact that in any homogeneous turbulence",that,rsta_1950_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1950

may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or,that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

"This is evident from the fact that when migration is slackening,",that,rstb_1951_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1951

follows from the already proved fact (§ 10) that theorem XIV,that,rsta_1951_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1951
appears to arise from the fact that Koehler had to split,that,rsta_1951_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1951
