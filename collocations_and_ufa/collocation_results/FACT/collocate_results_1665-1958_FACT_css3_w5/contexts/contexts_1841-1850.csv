in- teresting to verify the fact in the case of the,the,rstl_1842_0015.txt,txt_rstl

circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl
as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl

The most im- portant additional fact which we derive from the,the,rstl_1844_0006.txt,txt_rstl
with the alkalies render this fact of some importance. The $0-called,the,rstl_1844_0002.txt,txt_rstl

is the generalization of the fact of the proper current of,the,rstl_1845_0012.txt,txt_rstl

circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,in,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl

it is by the very fact alone of the decomposition of,the,rstl_1850_0038.txt,txt_rstl
