than actually existed.* The secretory facts are specially abundant in the,the,rstb_1895_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1895,37

endodermis was not developed. Secretory facts are scattered among the phloém-elements.,the,rstb_1895_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1895,37
We will first state the facts which prove that the appendages,the,rstb_1895_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1895,37

is afforded by the following facts :-- Stimulation of the 3rd,the,rstb_1897_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1897,37
