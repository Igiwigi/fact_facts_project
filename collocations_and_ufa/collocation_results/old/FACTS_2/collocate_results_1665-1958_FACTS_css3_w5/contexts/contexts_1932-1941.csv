obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

the testes lie in scrotal facts on either side of the,in,rstb_1932_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
On the convexity the following facts may be noted In the,in,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
perhaps slightly more. The relevant facts are recorded and discussed in,in,rstb_1932_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
The cavity in which the facts are contained is cut off,in,rstb_1932_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27

with some certainty. Thus the facts of association are strongly in,in,rstb_1932_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
In view of all these facts it appears highly probable that,in,rstb_1932_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27

to overlook the many interesting facts concerning colour change in this,in,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27

observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

On the convexity the following facts may be noted In the,the,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27

brain mentioned above. When the facts concerning the medial occipital region,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27

harmony with the above. Two facts so far stand out :,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work of,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,27
any apical system known. The facts seem to be that these,the,rstb_1938_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27
"partial survival may occur, the facts indicate that the oviposition response",the,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

independent of mitotic activity. The facts so far recorded relating to,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27
the living and non-living. The facts are there: we must adjust,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

In the light of the facts presented above it would appear,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

One of the most striking facts which emerge is that when,the,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
