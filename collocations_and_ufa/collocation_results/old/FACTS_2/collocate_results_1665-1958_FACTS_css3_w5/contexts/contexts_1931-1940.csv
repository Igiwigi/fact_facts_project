"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,29

the direction of Montserrat. These facts taken together suggest that the,the,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,29
one of the most far-reaching facts with which modern cytology has,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
"in the discussion, but no facts have so far been found",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
In the light of the facts presented above it would appear,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
here to account for the facts of chromosome elasticity. It should,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
possible the validity of the facts which have been used. This,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
seemed profitable to publish the facts as they stand in the,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
It is therefore to the facts in this paper rather than,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29

One of the most striking facts which emerge is that when,the,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,29
Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,29

"sufficient to represent the observed facts with high accuracy, so that",the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,29
not agree with the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,29
One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,29
to suggest that the nasal facts may have been situated in,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,29

"with, the head-process. Whilst these facts seem to be quite certain,",the,rstb_1931_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1931,29

in spite of all these facts the closed peripheral loops of,the,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,29

On the convexity the following facts may be noted In the,the,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,29

The cavity in which the facts are contained is cut off,the,rstb_1932_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1932,29

It is thought that the facts here recorded will be of,is,rstb_1934_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1934,29
is sharply defined. Two significant facts are observed : (a) that,is,rstb_1934_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1934,29
is at variance with the facts of development. In the first,is,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,29
"is in accord with the facts because, as has already been",is,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,29
; an explanation of the facts is put forward. The meteorological,is,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,29

"is in agreement with the facts observed by von Kocu (1882,",is,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,29

"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,29

the direction of Montserrat. These facts taken together suggest that the,the,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,29

impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29

"sufficient to represent the observed facts with high accuracy, so that",the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,29
not agree with the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,29
One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,29
to suggest that the nasal facts may have been situated in,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,29

on larval emergence. All these facts support the conclusion of Dre,the,rstb_1931_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1931,29

brain mentioned above. When the facts concerning the medial occipital region,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,29

impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,29

Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,29

not agree with the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,29
One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,29
to suggest that the nasal facts may have been situated in,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,29

in spite of all these facts the closed peripheral loops of,of,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,29
of the anatomy has revealed facts of a very unexpected nature.,of,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,29
with that of Htapteris. These facts raise questions of nomenclature and,of,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,29
