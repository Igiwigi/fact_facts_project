it tends to establish a fact which appears to me to,to,rstl_1837_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1837,14
able to discover it. The fact is that there is no,to,rstl_1837_0026.txt,txt_rstl,1837,14

general rules on which that fact has been now shown to,to,rstl_1838_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1838,14
"similar, is quite contrary to fact in every case except that",to,rstl_1838_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1838,14

"In metallic bodies, however, the fact appears to be very de-",the,rstl_1831_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1831,14

experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

perfect explanation from the additional fact of the augmented irritability or,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

"through its operation, do in fact give the greatest force and",the,rstl_1832_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
Of the Irritability. The single fact of a power of sustaining,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

perfect explanation from the additional fact of the augmented irritability or,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

"through its operation, do in fact give the greatest force and",the,rstl_1832_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

the bar: it is in fact owing to this circumstance that,this,rstl_1831_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1831,14
gorges its food entire. This fact might have been inferred from,this,rstl_1832_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
"the thicker ones. Till this fact is more fully ascertained, we",this,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
This certainly agrees with the fact much more nearly than might,this,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",this,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
classes. But the most remarkable fact deducible from this reasoning is,this,rstl_1832_0016.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
It is remarkable that this fact should not have been before,this,rstl_1833_0032.txt,txt_rstl,1833,14

at the changed pole. This fact may be obseryed by turning,this,rstl_1833_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1833,14

"bodies, and the like. This fact seems to have hitherto escaped",this,rstl_1834_0016.txt,txt_rstl,1834,14

the surrounding air. This important fact is now well ascertained. On,this,rstl_1835_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1835,14

"1829, 1830, and 1831. This fact will relieve HumBorpr from some",this,rstl_1835_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1835,14

This is a very inleresting fact ; and it will be,this,rstl_1836_0028.txt,txt_rstl,1836,14
that of the salmon. This fact was obseryed by LEeEUwennoek# and,this,rstl_1836_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1836,14

obseryed the same kind of fact strikingly illustrated in Norway#. It,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,14

"In metallic bodies, however, the fact appears to be very de-",the,rstl_1831_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1831,14

experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

perfect explanation from the additional fact of the augmented irritability or,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14

"through its operation, do in fact give the greatest force and",the,rstl_1832_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1832,14
