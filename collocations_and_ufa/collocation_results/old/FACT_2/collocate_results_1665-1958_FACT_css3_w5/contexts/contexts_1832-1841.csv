"of this great valley, —a fact somewhat analogous to the coincidence",the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15

obseryed the same kind of fact strikingly illustrated in Norway#. It,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15
and more especially the remarkable fact of the exact coincidence of,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
"in cartilage, follows from the fact that the cell-nuclei do not",the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
"42. In connexion with the fact now recorded, that muscular fibre",the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

presented to the iodine. This fact will render obvious the superiority,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
entire. But let not this fact militate against our conelusions. The,the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
"respiration continued, I established the fact that there was a source",the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
when compared with the remarkable fact which we shall find given,the,rstl_1840_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
It is a well known fact that the voltaic current will,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

at once removed by the fact of a spark of the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
"to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
hitherto hesitated to announce. The fact to which I allude is,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
"comparative anatomist, from the remarkable fact that it takes place in",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
"in coitu, but from the fact that the oviduct in the",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
have overlooked the remark- able fact of its remaining for many,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
observe no perfect fibre. This fact will safficiently account for the,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
as is shown in the fact that the new segments are,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15

well as to connect this fact with the existence of the,the,rstl_1841_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
"ascribed to them : the fact being that, besides the minuteness",the,rstl_1841_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15

This certainly agrees with the fact much more nearly than might,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
with the same plane. This fact has probably hitherto escaped de-,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"are readily discernible. But, the fact is rendered $till more evident",the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
Of the Irritability. The single fact of a power of sustaining,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"my former paper, and the fact is one of its most",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"of digestion, and in the fact of omit- ting to take",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
reviviscence from that state. The fact of the fatal influence of,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
perfect explanation from the additional fact of the augmented irritability or,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
classes. But the most remarkable fact deducible from this reasoning is,the,rstl_1832_0016.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"through its operation, do in fact give the greatest force and",the,rstl_1832_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"the fine metallic points, a fact which shows that the decomposition",the,rstl_1832_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
seemed most remarkable was the fact that the water in the,the,rstl_1832_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
out. It is an interesting fact that the gastric nerves are,the,rstl_1832_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
and from the ma- terial fact of its being in the,the,rstl_1832_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"the contrary direction resulted; the fact being, that in the first",the,rstl_1832_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15

"the process of solution, a fact particularly exposed in my paper",the,rstl_1834_0030.txt,txt_rstl,1834,15
from the parent. The principal fact on which I found this,the,rstl_1834_0026.txt,txt_rstl,1834,15
by some authors? The above fact would seem to indicate that,the,rstl_1834_0026.txt,txt_rstl,1834,15

to actual decomposition. Upon this fact is founded much of the,the,rstl_1834_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1834,15
"such appears to be the fact (697.), dependent upon a law,",the,rstl_1834_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1834,15

entirely on such evidence. The fact of their not having thus,the,rstl_1835_0021.txt,txt_rstl,1835,15
and that such is the fact is proved by the following,the,rstl_1835_0021.txt,txt_rstl,1835,15

by the water. If the fact is 80 in regard to,the,rstl_1835_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1835,15

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

doubting this curious fact. The fact is certainly not easily reconciled,this,rstl_1837_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1837,15
that this formula is in fact obtained by supposing the sum,this,rstl_1837_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1837,15

This Table also indicates the fact that the whole process of,this,rstl_1837_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1837,15

"of visible direction ; this fact had, though he was unaware",this,rstl_1838_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1838,15

"of this great valley, —a fact somewhat analogous to the coincidence",this,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15

presented to the iodine. This fact will render obvious the superiority,this,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,this,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,this,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
of its chief characteristics. This fact was first noticed long ago,this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
albuminous fluid and shell. This fact deserves particular consideration. A large,this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15

"more re- markable, from the fact that this outlet is in",this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15

"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15

obseryed the same kind of fact strikingly illustrated in Norway#. It,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15
and more especially the remarkable fact of the exact coincidence of,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
entire. But let not this fact militate against our conelusions. The,the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
"respiration continued, I established the fact that there was a source",the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
when compared with the remarkable fact which we shall find given,the,rstl_1840_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
hitherto hesitated to announce. The fact to which I allude is,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
"comparative anatomist, from the remarkable fact that it takes place in",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15

of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15
as is shown in the fact that the new segments are,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,15

"are readily discernible. But, the fact is rendered $till more evident",the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
Of the Irritability. The single fact of a power of sustaining,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"my former paper, and the fact is one of its most",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"of digestion, and in the fact of omit- ting to take",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
reviviscence from that state. The fact of the fatal influence of,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
perfect explanation from the additional fact of the augmented irritability or,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
classes. But the most remarkable fact deducible from this reasoning is,the,rstl_1832_0016.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"through its operation, do in fact give the greatest force and",the,rstl_1832_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
"the fine metallic points, a fact which shows that the decomposition",the,rstl_1832_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15
seemed most remarkable was the fact that the water in the,the,rstl_1832_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1832,15

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15

"similar, is quite contrary to fact in every case except that",to,rstl_1838_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1838,15

have now to mention a fact or two regarding the nature,to,rstl_1839_0021.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15
Laupsr endeayours to explain this fact by supposing that when the,to,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15

"of this great valley, —a fact somewhat analogous to the coincidence",to,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15
* This is a similar fact to what has been observed,to,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,15
it is to admit a fact made known by two of,to,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,15
