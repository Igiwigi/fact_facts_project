presented to the iodine. This fact will render obvious the superiority,this,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,this,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,this,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,this,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12
of its chief characteristics. This fact was first noticed long ago,this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12
albuminous fluid and shell. This fact deserves particular consideration. A large,this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12

"more re- markable, from the fact that this outlet is in",this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12

circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,in,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12

from a knowledge of the fact that both the amount of,the,rstl_1837_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1837,12

and more especially the remarkable fact of the exact coincidence of,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,12

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
"in cartilage, follows from the fact that the cell-nuclei do not",the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
"42. In connexion with the fact now recorded, that muscular fibre",the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

presented to the iodine. This fact will render obvious the superiority,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
entire. But let not this fact militate against our conelusions. The,the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
"respiration continued, I established the fact that there was a source",the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
when compared with the remarkable fact which we shall find given,the,rstl_1840_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
It is a well known fact that the voltaic current will,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

at once removed by the fact of a spark of the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
"to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
demonstrated. This depends on the fact that its contents swell considerably,the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
hitherto hesitated to announce. The fact to which I allude is,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12
3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12
"comparative anatomist, from the remarkable fact that it takes place in",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12

of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12

"a decisive opinion. But. the fact that the ellipticity, to whatever",the,rstl_1843_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,the,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
is the still more striking fact that alkalized water (2092.) having,the,rstl_1843_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12

"those of modern date, the fact will thus receive an explanation,",the,rstl_1844_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1844,12
In no instance has the fact been better exem- plified in,the,rstl_1844_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1844,12

The most im- portant additional fact which we derive from the,the,rstl_1844_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1844,12

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

is the still more striking fact that alkalized water (2092.) having,the,rstl_1843_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12

is the generalization of the fact of the proper current of,the,rstl_1845_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1845,12

The new substance belongs in fact to the class of the,the,rstl_1845_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1845,12

"of investigations into the fundamental fact of the induced contractions, I",the,rstl_1845_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1845,12

my numerous experiments : the fact of induced contractions is certainly,the,rstl_1845_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1845,12

"was the same, as in fact it ought to have been,",the,rstl_1845_0011.txt,txt_rstl,1845,12

"of these, the Tobacco, the fact may be accounted for, from",the,rstl_1845_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1845,12

this was very nearly the fact we may infer from Captain,was,rstl_1840_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
of its chief characteristics. This fact was first noticed long ago,was,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12

it tends to establish a fact which appears to me to,to,rstl_1837_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1837,12
able to discover it. The fact is that there is no,to,rstl_1837_0026.txt,txt_rstl,1837,12

general rules on which that fact has been now shown to,to,rstl_1838_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1838,12
"similar, is quite contrary to fact in every case except that",to,rstl_1838_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1838,12

"theories, which, according to every fact and analogy we are acquainted",to,rstl_1838_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1838,12

have now to mention a fact or two regarding the nature,to,rstl_1839_0021.txt,txt_rstl,1839,12
Laupsr endeayours to explain this fact by supposing that when the,to,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,12

"of this great valley, —a fact somewhat analogous to the coincidence",to,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,12
* This is a similar fact to what has been observed,to,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,12
it is to admit a fact made known by two of,to,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
presented to the iodine. This fact will render obvious the superiority,to,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
would draw attention to a fact which may hereafter prove of,to,rstl_1840_0019.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

to produce at all; a fact which seems difficult to deal,to,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
hitherto hesitated to announce. The fact to which I allude is,to,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

and more especially the remarkable fact of the exact coincidence of,the,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,12

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

when compared with the remarkable fact which we shall find given,the,rstl_1840_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
It is a well known fact that the voltaic current will,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12

to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,12
"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,12

previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,the,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
is the still more striking fact that alkalized water (2092.) having,the,rstl_1843_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,12

In no instance has the fact been better exem- plified in,the,rstl_1844_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1844,12

The most im- portant additional fact which we derive from the,the,rstl_1844_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1844,12

strongest argument being the ascertained fact of the land rising at,of,rstl_1839_0005.txt,txt_rstl,1839,12
