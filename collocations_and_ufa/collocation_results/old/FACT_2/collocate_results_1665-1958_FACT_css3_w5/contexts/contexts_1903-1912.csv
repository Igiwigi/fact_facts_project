on the vegetative organs. The fact that the cupular glands are,that,rstb_1905_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1905,24

for it is a well-established fact that the values of the,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
rigidities was complicated by the fact that the wire gradually drew,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
obtained. This accounts for the fact that in two or three,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

due in part to the fact that the wires they used,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
to lay stress on the fact that there is a tendency,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
accuracy on account of the fact that the rigidity determinations in,that,rsta_1905_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be attributed to the fact that the hottest regions of,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
finds considerable support in the fact that the stars give spectra,that,rsta_1905_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
must be connected with the fact that from these metals the,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
was due simply to the fact that from certain light radiators,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
considered in connection with the fact that the secondary radiation from,that,rsta_1905_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
small to account for the fact that the rigidity of these,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
not borne out by the fact that some of the fibres,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may possibly lie in the fact that the structure of fused,that,rsta_1905_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
unchanged ThX present. The observed fact that the hydroxide regains its,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

is an expression of the fact that the change is of,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
This is due to the fact that the‘supply of C due,that,rsta_1905_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

"gases, in consequence of the fact that the observed ratio of",that,rsta_1905_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is partially explained by the fact that my comparisons were at,that,rsta_1905_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
may be due to the fact that the method of producing,that,rsta_1905_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
formula has been employed. The fact that in any determination of,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
first method lies in the fact that the connecting tubes and,that,rsta_1905_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is really attributable to the fact that the mean sun-spot frequency,that,rsta_1905_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
number of sun-spot periods. The fact that in Table XX. a,that,rsta_1905_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
I drew attention to the fact that these figures bear to,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
I was encouraged by the fact that M. Le Roux himself,that,rsta_1905_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

"curves referred to, and the fact that this effect can already",that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
is mainly due to the fact that the slope of the,that,rsta_1905_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
(S—8’). This follows from the fact that the maximum (minimum) at,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
result is easily deduced. The fact that the value at a,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24
argument is independent of the fact that 8 is a finite,that,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

"are relatively rigid, and the fact that their internal walls are",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is partly due to the fact that the rate of flow,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
"average one, partly to the fact that all the vessels are",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

"actual amount, and, secondly, the fact that the amount of flow",that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
being probably due to the fact that a little of the,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24
is readily explained by the fact that the vessels are irregularly,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

to the radius itself. The fact that in the first column,that,rstb_1906_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1906,24

in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,this,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
against this assumption is the fact that the rat which died,this,rstb_1912_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

evidence is furnished from the fact that leaves of this type,this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

in this connection is the fact that principal filaments’ are ontogenetically,this,rstb_1903_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1903,24

in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,this,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

this alteration lies in the fact that the three samples of,this,rsta_1908_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24

this may account for the fact that the latter gives off,this,rstb_1911_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1911,24

in the large flow. This fact would tend to minimise the,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
is possibly owing to this fact that these measurements give values,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
against this assumption is the fact that the rat which died,this,rstb_1912_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

"to this hypothesis is the fact that, hitherto, impressions of C.",this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24
evidence is furnished from the fact that leaves of this type,this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

"may be seen from the fact that, as suggested above, the",the,rsta_1908_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24
is due simply to the fact that the hours of maxima,the,rsta_1908_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24
brings out very clearly the fact that the difference in type,the,rsta_1908_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24
"days are nearly equal. The fact that ¢, cs and ¢,",the,rsta_1908_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24

to be expected from the fact that water becomes positively charged,the,rsta_1908_0026.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24
up by the air. The fact that platinum black absorbs very,the,rsta_1908_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24
does so very slowly. The fact that while the leak is,the,rsta_1908_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24

This is exemplified by the fact that at a pressure of,the,rsta_1908_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24
receives some support from the fact that the hydrogen which diffuses,the,rsta_1908_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24
is rendered improbable by the fact that the ionisation in nitrogen,the,rsta_1908_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24
view is supported by the fact that after the high potential,the,rsta_1908_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1908,24

in this case from the fact that a lower semi-continuous function,this,rsta_1905_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1905,24

the centripetal xylem is a fact which supports this suggestion; but,this,rstb_1911_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1911,24

this may account for the fact that the latter gives off,this,rstb_1911_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1911,24

this extreme case in the fact that a short time only,this,rsta_1911_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24

in the large flow. This fact would tend to minimise the,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
is possibly owing to this fact that these measurements give values,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
against this assumption is the fact that the rat which died,this,rstb_1912_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

"to this hypothesis is the fact that, hitherto, impressions of C.",this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24
evidence is furnished from the fact that leaves of this type,this,rstb_1912_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1912,24

in this connection is the fact that principal filaments’ are ontogenetically,this,rstb_1903_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1903,24

first attempt to establish this fact and to determine the curve,this,rsta_1904_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1904,24

in the large flow. This fact would tend to minimise the,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
is possibly owing to this fact that these measurements give values,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
Correcting this value for the fact that Jony used the value,this,rsta_1911_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1911,24
