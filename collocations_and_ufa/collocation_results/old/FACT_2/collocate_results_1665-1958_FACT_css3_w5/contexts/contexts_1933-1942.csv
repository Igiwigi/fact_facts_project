One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not sufficiently",that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
part of the scheme; the fact that they were generated independently,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
; there is also the fact that at a speed of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
equilibrium diagrams now reveals the fact that where the alomic size,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently overlooked that,that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when there is asymmetry,",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains that it has survived",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
to be due to the fact that it is composed of,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
to be supported by the fact that breaks in the chain,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
chromosomes is indicated by the fact that all the wild species,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This was based upon the fact that in the forms which,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
which evidently results from the fact that the chromosomes pair mainly,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
Tables III-V show the remarkable fact that 93 out of 99,that,rstb_1935_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

be accounted for by the fact that one female weighed only,that,rstb_1935_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
region. In view of the fact that this layer has not,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
then in spite of the fact that the intercleavage intervals remain,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"however, and this explains the fact that the cleavage and gastrulation",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"(0 to m= m,; the fact that ¢, is a function",that,rsta_1935_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
load between the surfaces. The fact that oleic acid gives less,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
treatment with boiling water. This fact seems to indicate clearly that,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"electric field, consequent on the fact that the limit of the",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
showed the typical figure. The fact that many of these particles,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
960° C for silver. The fact that during the earlier stages,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
crystal can be understood. The fact that the edges of the,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem of,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
not the Griess tests. (The fact that the spray affected the,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,that,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
assume that they are in fact prepubertal. The testes of the,that,rstb_1936_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
principles underlying the theory. The fact that I is not zero,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

of course due to the fact that much of the albitic,that,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

of suggested foci must in fact satisfy the condition that there,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
the earthquakes have occurred. The fact that there are such large,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is,that,rsta_1938_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
Physically this corresponds to the fact that the edge of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

This is equivalent to the fact that the ground attenuation due,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

about the N-axis expresses the fact that the quartic (6) for,that,rsta_1938_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
this result depends on the fact that what we have been,that,rsta_1938_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not sufficiently",that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
part of the scheme; the fact that they were generated independently,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
; there is also the fact that at a speed of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
equilibrium diagrams now reveals the fact that where the alomic size,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
treatment with boiling water. This fact seems to indicate clearly that,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"electric field, consequent on the fact that the limit of the",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
showed the typical figure. The fact that many of these particles,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem of,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
not the Griess tests. (The fact that the spray affected the,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,that,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
principles underlying the theory. The fact that I is not zero,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

this result depends on the fact that what we have been,this,rsta_1938_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

owed its origin to the fact that a {110}-plane of this,this,rsta_1939_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1939,24
or vice versa. In this fact is probably to be found,this,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,24
this theory based on the fact that the estimated tempera- tures,this,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,24

this corresponds obviously to the fact that we are dealing with,this,rsta_1940_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24

This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,24

"vegetative cells were found. This fact shows that resting spores, provided",this,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

this result depends on the fact that what we have been,this,rsta_1938_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

owed its origin to the fact that a {110}-plane of this,this,rsta_1939_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1939,24

this theory based on the fact that the estimated tempera- tures,this,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,24

this corresponds obviously to the fact that we are dealing with,this,rsta_1940_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24

rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,in,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,in,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,in,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,in,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

suggestion is supported by the fact that in both the previous,is,rstb_1935_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently overlooked that,is,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

This is supported by the fact that hosts containing dead second,is,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

of this strain is in fact admixed with the 1 source,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24
doubtless is due to the fact that the original infection is,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is,is,rsta_1938_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
is only due to the fact that these infinite displacements are,is,rsta_1938_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

even more important is the fact that where they are found,is,rstb_1939_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

"must not be over-emphasized, the fact of chromosome shrinkage is abundantly",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24
This is due to the fact that the adult female is,is,rstb_1939_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

which is supported by the fact that the palatoquadrate in all,is,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24

of the graph is the fact that it should be possible,is,rstb_1940_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24

seizure of the surfaces. The fact that an electromotive force is,is,rsta_1940_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24
position is complicated by the fact that the strength of the,is,rsta_1940_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24

Of special interest is the fact that any sideward lean of,is,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,24
"point of view, the outstanding fact is that its ability to",is,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934,24

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,is,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,is,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

suggestion is supported by the fact that in both the previous,is,rstb_1935_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently overlooked that,is,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"must not be over-emphasized, the fact of chromosome shrinkage is abundantly",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24
This is due to the fact that the adult female is,is,rstb_1939_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

of the graph is the fact that it should be possible,is,rstb_1940_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24

of the pattern is the fact that the new peaks lie,is,rsta_1940_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,the,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,the,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24

shown (P. 501) by the fact that it can be displaced,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

"of specimen A, despite the fact that in specimen A the",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

the same phenomenon. Certainly the fact that a niche is present,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

the difficulties introduced by the fact that the probability law (70),the,rsta_1937_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1937,24

in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

shown (P. 501) by the fact that it can be displaced,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

days or more * This fact was referred to elsewhere in,to,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
it possible to relate the fact that the fibro- muscular tissue,to,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

has been drawn to the fact that these cords are to,to,rstb_1937_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
This is due to the fact that only those D cells,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

"a great distance, until in fact its ventral part came to",to,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",to,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
quantum equilibrium. It is this fact which makes us consider a,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
suggestion is supported by the fact that in both the previous,is,rstb_1935_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

elevations. It is a significant fact also that tubercles are not,is,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

of this strain is in fact admixed with the 1 source,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24
doubtless is due to the fact that the original infection is,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is,is,rsta_1938_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
is only due to the fact that these infinite displacements are,is,rsta_1938_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
This is due to the fact that when y — 7,is,rsta_1938_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

"Chellean implements, lies in the fact that it is just such",is,rstb_1939_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24
even more important is the fact that where they are found,is,rstb_1939_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

"is certainly owing to the fact that the coils, at these",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

"must not be over-emphasized, the fact of chromosome shrinkage is abundantly",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24
This is due to the fact that the adult female is,is,rstb_1939_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

the skull is found; in fact so rare is displacement that,is,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24
which is supported by the fact that the palatoquadrate in all,is,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24

of the graph is the fact that it should be possible,is,rstb_1940_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24

seizure of the surfaces. The fact that an electromotive force is,is,rsta_1940_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24
position is complicated by the fact that the strength of the,is,rsta_1940_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

girdle of Diplacanthus is in fact like that of Macropetalichthys. (6),is,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,is,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

Even its position is in fact different in that it is,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

"portrayed, as is also the fact that the sulcus frontalis inferior",is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
uniform is given by the fact that the results of the,is,rsta_1937_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1937,24

This is supported by the fact that hosts containing dead second,is,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

history is complicated by the fact that dryness and wetness of,is,rstb_1938_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

of this strain is in fact admixed with the 1 source,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24
doubtless is due to the fact that the original infection is,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is,is,rsta_1938_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
is only due to the fact that these infinite displacements are,is,rsta_1938_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
This is due to the fact that when y — 7,is,rsta_1938_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

"Chellean implements, lies in the fact that it is just such",is,rstb_1939_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24
even more important is the fact that where they are found,is,rstb_1939_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

"is certainly owing to the fact that the coils, at these",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

"must not be over-emphasized, the fact of chromosome shrinkage is abundantly",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24
This is due to the fact that the adult female is,is,rstb_1939_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1939,24

the skull is found; in fact so rare is displacement that,is,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24
which is supported by the fact that the palatoquadrate in all,is,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24

of the graph is the fact that it should be possible,is,rstb_1940_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1940,24

of the pattern is the fact that the new peaks lie,is,rsta_1940_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24

reversible effect occurs is in fact a characteristic of the particular,is,rsta_1940_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24
seizure of the surfaces. The fact that an electromotive force is,is,rsta_1940_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24
position is complicated by the fact that the strength of the,is,rsta_1940_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24
of the sliding solids. The fact that friction is not a,is,rsta_1940_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24
This is due to the fact that they use the repulsive,is,rsta_1940_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24

"has been taken of the fact that we may omit M,,s",the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"indicate little apart from the fact that thick clumps of ash,",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,the,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,the,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

this result depends on the fact that what we have been,this,rsta_1938_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

owed its origin to the fact that a {110}-plane of this,this,rsta_1939_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1939,24
or vice versa. In this fact is probably to be found,this,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,24
this theory based on the fact that the estimated tempera- tures,this,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,24

this corresponds obviously to the fact that we are dealing with,this,rsta_1940_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1940,24

This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933,24

justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,24
thickness of the membrane. This fact gives additional weight to the,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933,24
this is due to the fact that the solution is only,this,rsta_1933_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1933,24

days or more * This fact was referred to elsewhere in,to,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
it possible to relate the fact that the fibro- muscular tissue,to,rstb_1937_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

has been drawn to the fact that these cords are to,to,rstb_1937_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
This is due to the fact that only those D cells,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

"a great distance, until in fact its ventral part came to",to,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",to,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

position of the curves. The fact that there are now only,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"von Matrizen,” Berlin (1901)). The fact that the quotient of |a,\**""~4|",that,rsta_1934_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may now be completed. Another fact that may be useful in,that,rsta_1934_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not sufficiently",that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
part of the scheme; the fact that they were generated independently,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
; there is also the fact that at a speed of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
the series of patterns. The fact that the transverse rolls have,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
space is due to the fact that the smoke settles ;,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

bank. In view of the fact that in cloud banks of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
difficulty was occasioned by the fact that in this case neither,that,rsta_1934_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"has been taken of the fact that we may omit M,,s",that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
equilibrium diagrams now reveals the fact that where the alomic size,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

segregation in spite of the fact that they were sand castings.,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"Callorhynchus, shows that despite the fact that the region of the",that,rstb_1935_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",that,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,that,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when there is asymmetry,",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains that it has survived",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
region. In view of the fact that this layer has not,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24

to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936,24

Even its position is in fact different in that it is,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

of course due to the fact that much of the albitic,that,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

be due either to the fact that owing to the details,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
to be associated with the fact that the mean period of,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
as a result of the fact that certain relationships should exist,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
of suggested foci must in fact satisfy the condition that there,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
the earthquakes have occurred. The fact that there are such large,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is,that,rsta_1938_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
Physically this corresponds to the fact that the edge of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

part of the scheme; the fact that they were generated independently,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
; there is also the fact that at a speed of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
the series of patterns. The fact that the transverse rolls have,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
space is due to the fact that the smoke settles ;,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

bank. In view of the fact that in cloud banks of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
difficulty was occasioned by the fact that in this case neither,that,rsta_1934_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"has been taken of the fact that we may omit M,,s",that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
equilibrium diagrams now reveals the fact that where the alomic size,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
may be due to the fact that borax takes up a,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934,24
"Callorhynchus, shows that despite the fact that the region of the",that,rstb_1935_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when there is asymmetry,",that,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains that it has survived",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not,that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",that,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
region. In view of the fact that this layer has not,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,24

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
treatment with boiling water. This fact seems to indicate clearly that,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935,24

is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936,24

"may be afforded by the fact that in Pterychthiodes, which StENsto",that,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

Even its position is in fact different in that it is,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,24

of course due to the fact that much of the albitic,that,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,24

be due either to the fact that owing to the details,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
to be associated with the fact that the mean period of,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
as a result of the fact that certain relationships should exist,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
of suggested foci must in fact satisfy the condition that there,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
the earthquakes have occurred. The fact that there are such large,that,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is,that,rsta_1938_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
Physically this corresponds to the fact that the edge of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938,24
