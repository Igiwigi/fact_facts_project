this point :— “The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed,that,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found along,that,rstb_1887_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

revealed. Our opinion is that Fact 1 is sufficient argument for,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,that,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,that,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,that,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,that,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,that,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,that,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,that,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,that,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,that,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,that,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,that,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the first was the general fact that the great movements occur,that,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,that,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
proofs is seen in the fact that each of three of,that,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of,that,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are,that,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able,that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

seems due to % the fact that in the cardiac region,that,rstb_1888_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

in this case is the fact that a comparatively SSlimited bilateral,that,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,that,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,that,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

"however, be entirely correct—and the fact itself is strongly denied by",the,rstb_1887_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"positions ; and thirdly, the fact that the vomer, palatine, and",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"seen in Allosaurus, though the fact that the fourth metatarsal is",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"is, doubtless, due to the fact that the organisms, not being",the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
result is too high. The fact that the flask method and,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
this point :— “The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found along,the,rstb_1887_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
temperature is shown by the fact that they can be altered,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of an untested truism. The fact which we desired to clearly,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"rough one, owing to the fact that when the contraction is",the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

effect is indicated by the fact that the first variation consequent,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
4). This then is the fact ; our opinion concerning it,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the other Sauropida. In fact the urinary compartment described above,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly in the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"like Didelphys, and by the fact that in the Chelonia the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"the germinal vesicle, and the fact that the ovum completely fills",the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
any special glands. From the fact that these villi become longer,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
all round the ovum. This fact has led Se_enKa to describe,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
My«ine is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"species. Perhaps the most striking fact about them is their ubiquity,",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"cultivated in vain. The curious fact comes out, however, that when",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"substances, and it is a fact that the roots of our",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
possibly due partly to the fact that a larger proportion of,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
still more distinctly by the fact that of the mechanically ventilated,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"resisting the impure air. The fact that these schools become, as",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
dropping into the solution. The fact that the crystals were larger,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions improve,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"bad hygienic conditions. The mere fact that, the worse the hygienic",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
houses will be less. The fact that the mortality from croupous,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"this in spite of the fact that, once developed, the response",the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be broadly stated thus:,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"without sufficient foundation, and the fact must now be generally admitted.",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
“I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"produced by the light, a fact which I afterwards learnt was",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa has no,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself, in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

"fhe shell, and expressing the fact that the volume of the",the,rsta_1887_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,the,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
I have records of the fact in photo- graphs which I,the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"now presents itself from the fact that, if we divide» and",the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the difference lies in the fact that ScHLEreRMACHER surrounded the wire,the,rsta_1887_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

the Bay of Bengal. This fact 9s familiarly known to residents,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
doubtless to be attributed the fact of these regions having a,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"at once negatived by the fact that, even at Karachi and",the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
June ; and the very fact of the great dryness of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we should expect from the fact of the mean emperature of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,the,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

AND HORIZONTAL FORCE. 17 The fact of harmonious relations of this,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"its period. In the latter fact we found a suggestion that,",the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
priority of publication of this fact as regards the declination at,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
proofs is seen in the fact that each of three of,the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"allowance being made for the fact that, seen in transverse sections,",the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of,the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"fossil is the largest, that fact may help to account for",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"type of Marsupial, while the fact that as many as three",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"may be overcome, by the fact that many stages in ancestral",the,rstb_1888_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
of the somites is the fact that the so-called double segments,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
is accounted for by the fact that the solution has been,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
continuation forwards. Confirmation of the fact just stated with regard to,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
be accounted for by the fact that accurate comparisons between the,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
to be explained by the fact that the optic radiations into,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
always able to substantiate the fact that there was a diminution,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"in the lesion, but in fact they were completely softened and",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

as evidenced by the very fact of their so wholly supplanting,the,rstb_1887_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"set. And again, the mere fact that five out of the",the,rstb_1887_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

"however, be entirely correct—and the fact itself is strongly denied by",the,rstb_1887_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"positions ; and thirdly, the fact that the vomer, palatine, and",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"seen in Allosaurus, though the fact that the fourth metatarsal is",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"is, doubtless, due to the fact that the organisms, not being",the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
result is too high. The fact that the flask method and,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
this point :— “The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found along,the,rstb_1887_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
temperature is shown by the fact that they can be altered,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of an untested truism. The fact which we desired to clearly,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"rough one, owing to the fact that when the contraction is",the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

effect is indicated by the fact that the first variation consequent,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
4). This then is the fact ; our opinion concerning it,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the other Sauropida. In fact the urinary compartment described above,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly in the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"like Didelphys, and by the fact that in the Chelonia the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"the germinal vesicle, and the fact that the ovum completely fills",the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
any special glands. From the fact that these villi become longer,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
all round the ovum. This fact has led Se_enKa to describe,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
My«ine is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"species. Perhaps the most striking fact about them is their ubiquity,",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"cultivated in vain. The curious fact comes out, however, that when",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"substances, and it is a fact that the roots of our",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
possibly due partly to the fact that a larger proportion of,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
still more distinctly by the fact that of the mechanically ventilated,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"resisting the impure air. The fact that these schools become, as",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
dropping into the solution. The fact that the crystals were larger,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions improve,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"bad hygienic conditions. The mere fact that, the worse the hygienic",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
houses will be less. The fact that the mortality from croupous,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"this in spite of the fact that, once developed, the response",the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be broadly stated thus:,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"without sufficient foundation, and the fact must now be generally admitted.",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
“I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"produced by the light, a fact which I afterwards learnt was",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa has no,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself, in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

"fhe shell, and expressing the fact that the volume of the",the,rsta_1887_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,the,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
I have records of the fact in photo- graphs which I,the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"now presents itself from the fact that, if we divide» and",the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the difference lies in the fact that ScHLEreRMACHER surrounded the wire,the,rsta_1887_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

and pillar. 5. The remarkable fact observed by M. Tuore that,the,rsta_1887_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the Bay of Bengal. This fact 9s familiarly known to residents,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
doubtless to be attributed the fact of these regions having a,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"at once negatived by the fact that, even at Karachi and",the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
June ; and the very fact of the great dryness of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we should expect from the fact of the mean emperature of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,the,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

AND HORIZONTAL FORCE. 17 The fact of harmonious relations of this,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"its period. In the latter fact we found a suggestion that,",the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
priority of publication of this fact as regards the declination at,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
proofs is seen in the fact that each of three of,the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"allowance being made for the fact that, seen in transverse sections,",the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of,the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"fossil is the largest, that fact may help to account for",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"type of Marsupial, while the fact that as many as three",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"may be overcome, by the fact that many stages in ancestral",the,rstb_1888_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
of the somites is the fact that the so-called double segments,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
is accounted for by the fact that the solution has been,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
continuation forwards. Confirmation of the fact just stated with regard to,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
be accounted for by the fact that accurate comparisons between the,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
to be explained by the fact that the optic radiations into,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
always able to substantiate the fact that there was a diminution,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"in the lesion, but in fact they were completely softened and",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
sufficient to account for the fact that the paralysis extended to,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

seems due to % the fact that in the cardiac region,the,rstb_1888_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

phenomenon was due to the fact that in the thicker film,the,rstl_1886_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1886,26

"positions ; and thirdly, the fact that the vomer, palatine, and",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"seen in Allosaurus, though the fact that the fourth metatarsal is",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"is, doubtless, due to the fact that the organisms, not being",the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

this point :— “The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found along,the,rstb_1887_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
temperature is shown by the fact that they can be altered,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of an untested truism. The fact which we desired to clearly,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

effect is indicated by the fact that the first variation consequent,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the other Sauropida. In fact the urinary compartment described above,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly in the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"like Didelphys, and by the fact that in the Chelonia the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"the germinal vesicle, and the fact that the ovum completely fills",the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
any special glands. From the fact that these villi become longer,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
all round the ovum. This fact has led Se_enKa to describe,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
My«ine is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"species. Perhaps the most striking fact about them is their ubiquity,",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"cultivated in vain. The curious fact comes out, however, that when",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"substances, and it is a fact that the roots of our",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
possibly due partly to the fact that a larger proportion of,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
still more distinctly by the fact that of the mechanically ventilated,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"resisting the impure air. The fact that these schools become, as",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
dropping into the solution. The fact that the crystals were larger,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions improve,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"bad hygienic conditions. The mere fact that, the worse the hygienic",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
houses will be less. The fact that the mortality from croupous,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"this in spite of the fact that, once developed, the response",the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be broadly stated thus:,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"without sufficient foundation, and the fact must now be generally admitted.",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
“I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"produced by the light, a fact which I afterwards learnt was",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa has no,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself, in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

I have records of the fact in photo- graphs which I,the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"now presents itself from the fact that, if we divide» and",the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we should expect from the fact of the mean emperature of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,the,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

"is accounted for by the fact that the film, though colourless,",the,rstl_1886_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1886,26

"MENSBRUGGHE left ib, but the fact that it has led to",the,rstl_1886_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1886,26

"of a crimson hue, The fact that the red and blue",the,rstl_1886_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1886,26

"set. And again, the mere fact that five out of the",the,rstb_1887_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

"however, be entirely correct—and the fact itself is strongly denied by",the,rstb_1887_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"positions ; and thirdly, the fact that the vomer, palatine, and",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"seen in Allosaurus, though the fact that the fourth metatarsal is",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"is, doubtless, due to the fact that the organisms, not being",the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
result is too high. The fact that the flask method and,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
this point :— “The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found along,the,rstb_1887_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
temperature is shown by the fact that they can be altered,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of an untested truism. The fact which we desired to clearly,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"rough one, owing to the fact that when the contraction is",the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

effect is indicated by the fact that the first variation consequent,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the other Sauropida. In fact the urinary compartment described above,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly in the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"like Didelphys, and by the fact that in the Chelonia the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"the germinal vesicle, and the fact that the ovum completely fills",the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
any special glands. From the fact that these villi become longer,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
all round the ovum. This fact has led Se_enKa to describe,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
My«ine is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"species. Perhaps the most striking fact about them is their ubiquity,",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"cultivated in vain. The curious fact comes out, however, that when",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"substances, and it is a fact that the roots of our",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
possibly due partly to the fact that a larger proportion of,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
still more distinctly by the fact that of the mechanically ventilated,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"resisting the impure air. The fact that these schools become, as",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
dropping into the solution. The fact that the crystals were larger,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions improve,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"bad hygienic conditions. The mere fact that, the worse the hygienic",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
houses will be less. The fact that the mortality from croupous,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"this in spite of the fact that, once developed, the response",the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be broadly stated thus:,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"without sufficient foundation, and the fact must now be generally admitted.",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
“I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"produced by the light, a fact which I afterwards learnt was",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa has no,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself, in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

"fhe shell, and expressing the fact that the volume of the",the,rsta_1887_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,the,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
I have records of the fact in photo- graphs which I,the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"now presents itself from the fact that, if we divide» and",the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

"at once negatived by the fact that, even at Karachi and",the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we should expect from the fact of the mean emperature of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,the,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,that,rsta_1887_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
"fhe shell, and expressing the fact that the volume of the",that,rsta_1887_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,that,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,that,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the difference lies in the fact that ScHLEreRMACHER surrounded the wire,that,rsta_1887_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,that,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,that,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,that,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,that,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the first was the general fact that the great movements occur,that,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,that,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
proofs is seen in the fact that each of three of,that,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of,that,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are,that,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able,that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

in this case is the fact that a comparatively SSlimited bilateral,that,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

this point :— “The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed,that,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found along,that,rstb_1887_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

revealed. Our opinion is that Fact 1 is sufficient argument for,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were,that,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,that,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,that,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

My«ine is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen,that,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,that,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,that,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,that,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,26

is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,that,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,that,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26

in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,that,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,that,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,that,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,that,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
the first was the general fact that the great movements occur,that,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,that,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887,26
proofs is seen in the fact that each of three of,that,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of,that,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are,that,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able,that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

seems due to % the fact that in the cardiac region,that,rstb_1888_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26

in this case is the fact that a comparatively SSlimited bilateral,that,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888,26
