the full admission of this fact does not invalidate the results,this,rstl_1830_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1830,12

"the thicker ones. Till this fact is more fully ascertained, we",this,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12
This certainly agrees with the fact much more nearly than might,this,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",this,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12
"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12
Of the Irritability. The single fact of a power of sustaining,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

perfect explanation from the additional fact of the augmented irritability or,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12
classes. But the most remarkable fact deducible from this reasoning is,the,rstl_1832_0016.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12
"through its operation, do in fact give the greatest force and",the,rstl_1832_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12
"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

perfect explanation from the additional fact of the augmented irritability or,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

"through its operation, do in fact give the greatest force and",the,rstl_1832_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the,the,rstl_1832_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12
"the respiration is diminished. This fact was first determined, in regard",the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

perfect explanation from the additional fact of the augmented irritability or,the,rstl_1832_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12

"through its operation, do in fact give the greatest force and",the,rstl_1832_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1832,12
