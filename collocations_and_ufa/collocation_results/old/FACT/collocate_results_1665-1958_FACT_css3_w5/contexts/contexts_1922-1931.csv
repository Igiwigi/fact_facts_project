against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
of the endoskeletal system. The fact just mentioned that the valve,that,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
no doubt arises from the fact that food substances are continually,that,rstb_1926_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"This is due to the fact that the dispersion-constant A,° of",this,rsta_1922_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1922
Advantage was taken of this fact to make the instrument of,this,rsta_1922_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1922

"the same level. This unexpected fact simplifies the observer’s work. Finally,",this,rsta_1923_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1923

"the oscillations be small, this fact limits the range of possible",this,rsta_1923_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1923

this is supported by a fact to which Prof. Hass has,this,rsta_1923_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1923

in this case is in fact (4-035 —3-80)/1-73 = 0-136 cm.,this,rsta_1923_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1923
appreciable.§ MaxweE.t suggested that this fact might provide a possible explanation,this,rsta_1923_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1923
"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",this,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924
conclusion is suggested by the fact that in specimen C this,this,rstb_1924_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1924
"symmetrical with it, whereas in fact this latter vessel is asymmetrical",this,rstb_1924_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1924
This was due to the fact that the grating employed was,this,rsta_1924_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1924
through the zero. From this fact we may draw two important,this,rsta_1924_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1924

This is explainable by the fact that since the velocity of,this,rsta_1924_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1924

other forms. Associated with this fact is the presence of a,this,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
plot. In view of this fact we cannot deny the possibility,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"this period, allowing for the fact that adjacent points are not",this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,this,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated,this,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

for stating this being the fact that we have just recently,this,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that in the case of,this,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"to this view is the fact that, while the latter are",this,rstb_1926_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1926

attached to this feature. The fact that there is no “,this,rstb_1928_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1928
to isolate it. But this fact iselfis no valid argument in,this,rstb_1928_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1928
this in spite of the fact that ground- up shells form,this,rstb_1928_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1928
this is confirmed by the fact that for a considerable portion,this,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928
= 0. This expresses the fact that the 0 end of,this,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928
section. This example illustrates the fact that the existence of a,this,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928
the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929
the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929
the xylem is star-shaped. This fact justifies the generic separation of,this,rstb_1929_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1929
The significance of this important fact will be discussed later. The,this,rstb_1929_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1929

"the same level. This unexpected fact simplifies the observer’s work. Finally,",this,rsta_1923_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1923

in this case is in fact (4-035 —3-80)/1-73 = 0-136 cm.,this,rsta_1923_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1923
appreciable.§ MaxweE.t suggested that this fact might provide a possible explanation,this,rsta_1923_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1923
"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",this,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"symmetrical with it, whereas in fact this latter vessel is asymmetrical",this,rstb_1924_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1924
This was due to the fact that the grating employed was,this,rsta_1924_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1924
through the zero. From this fact we may draw two important,this,rsta_1924_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1924

other forms. Associated with this fact is the presence of a,this,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"this period, allowing for the fact that adjacent points are not",this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,this,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated,this,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

for stating this being the fact that we have just recently,this,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that in the case of,this,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"to this view is the fact that, while the latter are",this,rstb_1926_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1926

attached to this feature. The fact that there is no “,this,rstb_1928_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1928
to isolate it. But this fact iselfis no valid argument in,this,rstb_1928_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1928
this in spite of the fact that ground- up shells form,this,rstb_1928_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1928
this is confirmed by the fact that for a considerable portion,this,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928
= 0. This expresses the fact that the 0 end of,this,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928
section. This example illustrates the fact that the existence of a,this,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928
the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929
the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929

from these results is the fact that for the integrated radiation,is,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

is also shown by the fact that at their distal ends,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this is a point of fact on which my conclusion was,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

that even allowing for the fact that it is the highest,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
extraordinarily close. It is in fact better than one has any,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is to be added the fact that errors of sampling in,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

applicable to viscous fluids. In fact it is a remarkable feature,is,rsta_1923_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1923
from these results is the fact that for the integrated radiation,is,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923
formula (22) somewhat obscures the fact that the emergent radiation is,is,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923
that the star is in fact provided with a very extensive,is,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

of the observations themselves. In fact the fit is so close,is,rsta_1923_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1923
considerable difficulty arose from the fact that the manganese spectrum is,is,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923
difficulty is caused by the fact that the lines are grouped,is,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923
division is due to the fact that the experimental work does,is,rsta_1923_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1923
above we have used the fact that C?R(C®) is zero by,is,rsta_1923_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1923

"Research, Most striking is the fact that in all three types",is,rstb_1924_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",is,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"B, and it is in fact clear that the general solution",is,rsta_1924_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1924
Thus our process is in fact valid for a much more,is,rsta_1924_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1924

"the expression for K,. In fact K, is the induced electric",is,rsta_1924_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1924
This is explainable by the fact that since the velocity of,is,rsta_1924_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1924
is also shown by the fact that at their distal ends,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this is a point of fact on which my conclusion was,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

such a manner ? The fact that the cicatricial epithelium is,is,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
that even allowing for the fact that it is the highest,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
identical. As a matter of fact the winter dip is slightly,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
extraordinarily close. It is in fact better than one has any,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is to be added the fact that errors of sampling in,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the Hercynian movements. When that fact is allowed for, a striking",is,rstb_1925_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the,is,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,is,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"and below is examined, the fact that the effect can extend",is,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

is further supported by the fact that an independent pharyngohyal cartilage,is,rstb_1926_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1926
is accurately known from the fact that the interval separating the,is,rsta_1926_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1926

of these experiments is the fact that the injection of the,is,rstb_1931_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1931

tem- perature (p. 245). The fact that it is not necessary,is,rstb_1931_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1931
castration is due to the fact that the animals were kept,is,rstb_1931_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1931

The discrepancy arises from the fact that DaNGEARD’S paper was not,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

must be drawn to the fact that on many of the,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

I attribute largely to the fact that the implants were always,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that the phenomena of invasion",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon granules could,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
specimens of lung. But one fact stands out: the alveolay epithelial,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
high correlations lies in the fact that the particular variates chosen,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
chosen because they appear in fact to be associated with the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells,",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
follows at once from the fact that the distri- bution of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
plot. In view of this fact we cannot deny the possibility,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"with the rainy periods. The fact of the coincidence, whether causal",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928

reasonable objection lies in the fact that the genus T'elangium was,the,rstb_1931_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1931
"and, in view of the fact that in Spathulopleris the frond",the,rstb_1931_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1931

main difference lies in the fact that the proctodzeum begins to,the,rstb_1931_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1931

The discrepancy arises from the fact that DaNGEARD’S paper was not,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

p. 161 below). § This fact might indicate that the scales,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
must be drawn to the fact that on many of the,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"far as observed, in the fact that the sieve-plates are always",the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

leaf-traces of Asteroxylon in the fact that they stop short at,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
I attribute largely to the fact that the implants were always,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that the phenomena of invasion",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"they become. Owing to the fact that, quite apart from mitotic",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon granules could,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
specimens of lung. But one fact stands out: the alveolay epithelial,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
high correlations lies in the fact that the particular variates chosen,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
chosen because they appear in fact to be associated with the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells,",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
follows at once from the fact that the distri- bution of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"if not wholly, by the fact that the mortality, in any",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
; and by the second fact that mortality in the two,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the charts, and are in fact an integral part of the",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
plot. In view of this fact we cannot deny the possibility,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"with the rainy periods. The fact of the coincidence, whether causal",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
period must be set the fact that in our diagrams the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

can be based on the fact that we have no experience,the,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
due no doubt to the fact that the two sets of,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
results there is first the fact that the number of eggs,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

find further illustration in the fact that the percentages hatched in,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

may be due to the fact that segmental excretory organs are,the,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,the,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

from the Sinusoidal Form.—In actual fact the wave of electromotive force,the,rsta_1928_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1928
as is shown by the fact that the series obtained by,the,rsta_1928_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1928
this is confirmed by the fact that for a considerable portion,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928
arrangement is conditioned by the fact that in the adjusted es,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928

Ng. On account of the fact that one such pair of,the,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928

labour is ofiset by the fact that in practice there is,the,rsta_1928_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1928
"of the same parameter. The fact that z,, «4, ¢ are",the,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928

in the wrong direction. The fact that so big a difference,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928
is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928
its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928

number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929

from these results is the fact that for the integrated radiation,is,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

that even allowing for the fact that it is the highest,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

is to be added the fact that errors of sampling in,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

from these results is the fact that for the integrated radiation,is,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

considerable difficulty arose from the fact that the manganese spectrum is,is,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923
difficulty is caused by the fact that the lines are grouped,is,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923
division is due to the fact that the experimental work does,is,rsta_1923_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1923
above we have used the fact that C?R(C®) is zero by,is,rsta_1923_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1923

"Research, Most striking is the fact that in all three types",is,rstb_1924_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",is,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924
is also strictly comparable. The fact that in Estheria the connection,is,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"B, and it is in fact clear that the general solution",is,rsta_1924_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1924
Thus our process is in fact valid for a much more,is,rsta_1924_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1924

"the expression for K,. In fact K, is the induced electric",is,rsta_1924_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1924
This is explainable by the fact that since the velocity of,is,rsta_1924_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1924
is also shown by the fact that at their distal ends,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this is a point of fact on which my conclusion was,is,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

such a manner ? The fact that the cicatricial epithelium is,is,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
that even allowing for the fact that it is the highest,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
identical. As a matter of fact the winter dip is slightly,is,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
extraordinarily close. It is in fact better than one has any,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is to be added the fact that errors of sampling in,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
mutations artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by,is,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under a,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,is,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of this region is the fact that many of the tributaries,is,rstb_1925_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the Hercynian movements. When that fact is allowed for, a striking",is,rstb_1925_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1925
is probably connected with the fact that the lumen of the,is,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926
against this comparison is the fact that the valve arises before,is,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"and below is examined, the fact that the effect can extend",is,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

these formal resemblances is the fact that in every respect their,is,rstb_1926_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1926
habit is confirmed by the fact that whilst the Old Red,is,rstb_1926_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1926

is further supported by the fact that an independent pharyngohyal cartilage,is,rstb_1926_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1926
is accurately known from the fact that the interval separating the,is,rsta_1926_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1926

OF quantities agree. The important fact is that ~/I1s — +/2p,is,rsta_1926_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1926

must be drawn to the fact that on many of the,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

I attribute largely to the fact that the implants were always,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that the phenomena of invasion",the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925

view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon granules could,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
specimens of lung. But one fact stands out: the alveolay epithelial,the,rstb_1925_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1925
high correlations lies in the fact that the particular variates chosen,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
chosen because they appear in fact to be associated with the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells,",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
follows at once from the fact that the distri- bution of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"the charts, and are in fact an integral part of the",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
view is confirmed by the fact that among the remaining plots,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the alternating series has,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
plot. In view of this fact we cannot deny the possibility,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
"with the rainy periods. The fact of the coincidence, whether causal",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
period must be set the fact that in our diagrams the,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"this period, allowing for the fact that adjacent points are not",the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

due no doubt to the fact that the two sets of,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
well have shown itself. The fact that the eight turns were,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
But there is the further fact that the differences are of,the,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"of the same parameter. The fact that z,, «4, ¢ are",the,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928

is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928
its premier position to the fact that its positive and negative,the,rsta_1928_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1928

number of root-origins observed —a fact which indicates that the roots,the,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929

especially taking into account the fact that Fraunhofer lines appear to,the,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923

must be drawn to the fact that on many of the,the,rstb_1925_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1925

slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",this,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"symmetrical with it, whereas in fact this latter vessel is asymmetrical",this,rstb_1924_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1924
This was due to the fact that the grating employed was,this,rsta_1924_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1924
through the zero. From this fact we may draw two important,this,rsta_1924_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1924

out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated,this,rstb_1926_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1926

for stating this being the fact that we have just recently,this,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that in the case of,this,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

to isolate it. But this fact iselfis no valid argument in,this,rstb_1928_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1928
this in spite of the fact that ground- up shells form,this,rstb_1928_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1928

section. This example illustrates the fact that the existence of a,this,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928
the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929
the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929

"This is due to the fact that the dispersion-constant A,° of",this,rsta_1922_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1922

"the same level. This unexpected fact simplifies the observer’s work. Finally,",this,rsta_1923_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1923

this is supported by a fact to which Prof. Hass has,this,rsta_1923_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1923

in this case is in fact (4-035 —3-80)/1-73 = 0-136 cm.,this,rsta_1923_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1923
appreciable.§ MaxweE.t suggested that this fact might provide a possible explanation,this,rsta_1923_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1923
"support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius,",this,rstb_1924_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1924

"symmetrical with it, whereas in fact this latter vessel is asymmetrical",this,rstb_1924_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1924
This was due to the fact that the grating employed was,this,rsta_1924_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1924
through the zero. From this fact we may draw two important,this,rsta_1924_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1924

out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect may be,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
the regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925
this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations,this,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925

of this result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925
from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface,this,rstb_1925_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1925

for stating this being the fact that we have just recently,this,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926
This is due to the fact that in the case of,this,rstb_1926_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1926

"to this view is the fact that, while the latter are",this,rstb_1926_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1926

attached to this feature. The fact that there is no “,this,rstb_1928_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1928

this in spite of the fact that ground- up shells form,this,rstb_1928_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1928
this is confirmed by the fact that for a considerable portion,this,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928
= 0. This expresses the fact that the 0 end of,this,rsta_1928_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1928
section. This example illustrates the fact that the existence of a,this,rsta_1928_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1928
the base was attained. This fact alone gives some idea of,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929
the one actually seen. This fact is of great use in,this,rstb_1929_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1929
