being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,that,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,that,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887

is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,that,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887

is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887

in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,that,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887

is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,that,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,that,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887

in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,that,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,that,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,that,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,that,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the first was the general fact that the great movements occur,that,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,that,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
proofs is seen in the fact that each of three of,that,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888

is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888

"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",that,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888

"positions ; and thirdly, the fact that the vomer, palatine, and",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"seen in Allosaurus, though the fact that the fourth metatarsal is",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"is, doubtless, due to the fact that the organisms, not being",the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887
result is too high. The fact that the flask method and,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887
this point :— “The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found along,the,rstb_1887_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1887
by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887
temperature is shown by the fact that they can be altered,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of an untested truism. The fact which we desired to clearly,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887

effect is indicated by the fact that the first variation consequent,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887

It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of the other Sauropida. In fact the urinary compartment described above,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly in the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"like Didelphys, and by the fact that in the Chelonia the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"the germinal vesicle, and the fact that the ovum completely fills",the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
any special glands. From the fact that these villi become longer,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
all round the ovum. This fact has led Se_enKa to describe,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
My«ine is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"species. Perhaps the most striking fact about them is their ubiquity,",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"cultivated in vain. The curious fact comes out, however, that when",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"substances, and it is a fact that the roots of our",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
possibly due partly to the fact that a larger proportion of,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
still more distinctly by the fact that of the mechanically ventilated,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"resisting the impure air. The fact that these schools become, as",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
dropping into the solution. The fact that the crystals were larger,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions improve,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"bad hygienic conditions. The mere fact that, the worse the hygienic",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
houses will be less. The fact that the mortality from croupous,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"this in spite of the fact that, once developed, the response",the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be broadly stated thus:,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"without sufficient foundation, and the fact must now be generally admitted.",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
“I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"produced by the light, a fact which I afterwards learnt was",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa has no,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself, in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1887

is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,the,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887
I have records of the fact in photo- graphs which I,the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"now presents itself from the fact that, if we divide» and",the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887
may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the difference lies in the fact that ScHLEreRMACHER surrounded the wire,the,rsta_1887_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1887

doubtless to be attributed the fact of these regions having a,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"at once negatived by the fact that, even at Karachi and",the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887

in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
we should expect from the fact of the mean emperature of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,the,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887

AND HORIZONTAL FORCE. 17 The fact of harmonious relations of this,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"its period. In the latter fact we found a suggestion that,",the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
priority of publication of this fact as regards the declination at,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887

"allowance being made for the fact that, seen in transverse sections,",the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888
for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of,the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"fossil is the largest, that fact may help to account for",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"type of Marsupial, while the fact that as many as three",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"may be overcome, by the fact that many stages in ancestral",the,rstb_1888_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1888
of the somites is the fact that the so-called double segments,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888
is accounted for by the fact that the solution has been,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888
continuation forwards. Confirmation of the fact just stated with regard to,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
be accounted for by the fact that accurate comparisons between the,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888

which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly in the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"like Didelphys, and by the fact that in the Chelonia the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"the germinal vesicle, and the fact that the ovum completely fills",the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
any special glands. From the fact that these villi become longer,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
all round the ovum. This fact has led Se_enKa to describe,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
My«ine is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"species. Perhaps the most striking fact about them is their ubiquity,",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"cultivated in vain. The curious fact comes out, however, that when",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"substances, and it is a fact that the roots of our",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
possibly due partly to the fact that a larger proportion of,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
still more distinctly by the fact that of the mechanically ventilated,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"resisting the impure air. The fact that these schools become, as",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
dropping into the solution. The fact that the crystals were larger,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions improve,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"bad hygienic conditions. The mere fact that, the worse the hygienic",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
houses will be less. The fact that the mortality from croupous,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"this in spite of the fact that, once developed, the response",the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be broadly stated thus:,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"without sufficient foundation, and the fact must now be generally admitted.",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
“I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"produced by the light, a fact which I afterwards learnt was",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa has no,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself, in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1887

cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1887
is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,the,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887
I have records of the fact in photo- graphs which I,the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"now presents itself from the fact that, if we divide» and",the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887
may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the difference lies in the fact that ScHLEreRMACHER surrounded the wire,the,rsta_1887_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1887

doubtless to be attributed the fact of these regions having a,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"at once negatived by the fact that, even at Karachi and",the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
June ; and the very fact of the great dryness of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
we should expect from the fact of the mean emperature of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,the,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887

AND HORIZONTAL FORCE. 17 The fact of harmonious relations of this,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"its period. In the latter fact we found a suggestion that,",the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
priority of publication of this fact as regards the declination at,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
proofs is seen in the fact that each of three of,the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"allowance being made for the fact that, seen in transverse sections,",the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888
for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of,the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"fossil is the largest, that fact may help to account for",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"type of Marsupial, while the fact that as many as three",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"may be overcome, by the fact that many stages in ancestral",the,rstb_1888_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1888
of the somites is the fact that the so-called double segments,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888
is accounted for by the fact that the solution has been,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888
continuation forwards. Confirmation of the fact just stated with regard to,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
be accounted for by the fact that accurate comparisons between the,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
to be explained by the fact that the optic radiations into,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
always able to substantiate the fact that there was a diminution,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"in the lesion, but in fact they were completely softened and",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
sufficient to account for the fact that the paralysis extended to,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
no doubt due to the fact that the lesion was not,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888

seems due to % the fact that in the cardiac region,the,rstb_1888_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1888

furnishes an illustration of the fact that hernia cerebri is apt,the,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888
partly on account of the fact that the a animal had,the,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888
The > significance of this fact will be afterwards alluded to.,the,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888
in this case is the fact that a comparatively SSlimited bilateral,the,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"angular gyrus, but to the fact that, in removing this convolution,",the,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888
opinion rests mainly upon the fact that a very temporary visual,the,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"once struck with the remarkable fact that, while the organ has",the,rstb_1888_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1888

may be due to the fact that the different regions of,the,rstb_1888_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1888
This will probably explain the fact that this rotation of the,the,rstb_1888_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1888

dropping into the solution. The fact that the crystals were larger,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions improve,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"bad hygienic conditions. The mere fact that, the worse the hygienic",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
houses will be less. The fact that the mortality from croupous,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"this in spite of the fact that, once developed, the response",the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be broadly stated thus:,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"without sufficient foundation, and the fact must now be generally admitted.",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
“I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"produced by the light, a fact which I afterwards learnt was",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa has no,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself, in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
cause of geological distortion. The fact that the region of maximum,the,rsta_1887_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1887

is borne out by the fact that he did not determine,the,rsta_1887_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1887
I have records of the fact in photo- graphs which I,the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"now presents itself from the fact that, if we divide» and",the,rsta_1887_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1887
may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the difference lies in the fact that ScHLEreRMACHER surrounded the wire,the,rsta_1887_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1887

doubtless to be attributed the fact of these regions having a,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"at once negatived by the fact that, even at Karachi and",the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887

in some measure to the fact that the night winds have,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
we should expect from the fact of the mean emperature of,the,rsta_1887_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1887
we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the,the,rsta_1887_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1887
was probably due to the fact that he position of the,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887
further vitiated by ; the fact that some of the water,the,rsta_1887_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1887

AND HORIZONTAL FORCE. 17 The fact of harmonious relations of this,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
"its period. In the latter fact we found a suggestion that,",the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
is sufficiently explained by the fact that the typical variations for,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887
priority of publication of this fact as regards the declination at,the,rsta_1887_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1887

"allowance being made for the fact that, seen in transverse sections,",the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888
for the same reasons. The fact that so many specimens of,the,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"fossil is the largest, that fact may help to account for",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"type of Marsupial, while the fact that as many as three",the,rstb_1888_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"may be overcome, by the fact that many stages in ancestral",the,rstb_1888_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1888
of the somites is the fact that the so-called double segments,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888
is accounted for by the fact that the solution has been,the,rstb_1888_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1888
continuation forwards. Confirmation of the fact just stated with regard to,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
be accounted for by the fact that accurate comparisons between the,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are,the,rstb_1888_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1888
is physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
"It is, however, undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
to be explained by the fact that the optic radiations into,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888

"in the lesion, but in fact they were completely softened and",the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888
sufficient to account for the fact that the paralysis extended to,the,rstb_1888_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1888

The > significance of this fact will be afterwards alluded to.,the,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888
in this case is the fact that a comparatively SSlimited bilateral,the,rstb_1888_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1888

"seen in Allosaurus, though the fact that the fourth metatarsal is",the,rstb_1887_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1887

this point :— “The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed,the,rstb_1887_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found along,the,rstb_1887_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1887
by our observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887
temperature is shown by the fact that they can be altered,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of an untested truism. The fact which we desired to clearly,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887

It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were,the,rstb_1887_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of the other Sauropida. In fact the urinary compartment described above,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly in the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and is strengthened by the fact that neither the true terrestrial,the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"like Didelphys, and by the fact that in the Chelonia the",the,rstb_1887_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"the germinal vesicle, and the fact that the ovum completely fills",the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
any special glands. From the fact that these villi become longer,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
all round the ovum. This fact has led Se_enKa to describe,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
My«ine is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen,the,rstb_1887_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"species. Perhaps the most striking fact about them is their ubiquity,",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"cultivated in vain. The curious fact comes out, however, that when",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"substances, and it is a fact that the roots of our",the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt,the,rstb_1887_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1887
possibly due partly to the fact that a larger proportion of,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
still more distinctly by the fact that of the mechanically ventilated,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887

and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions improve,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"bad hygienic conditions. The mere fact that, the worse the hygienic",the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887

being caused by micro-organisms. The fact that it is rather less,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is due probably to the fact that it is to a,the,rstb_1887_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1887
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"this in spite of the fact that, once developed, the response",the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be broadly stated thus:,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the nerve-organ response itself. The fact that in the one case,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of,the,rstb_1887_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1887
difficulty was experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"without sufficient foundation, and the fact must now be generally admitted.",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
“I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"produced by the light, a fact which I afterwards learnt was",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
of the observations and the fact that the experiment began about,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
(8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"in this paper is the fact that the larvee of D.,",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887

"tubes. It is probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
is probably due to the fact that the gilt chamber when,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
did not allow for the fact that the larva always spins,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa has no,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"colour is produced, and the fact that it is probably less",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself, in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
in the reverse order. The fact that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
"be very clear, and the fact that the pups hang in",the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
and orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887
the larva before pupation. This fact appears to prove that the,the,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887

may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887
the proof consists in the fact that the As variations are,the,rsta_1887_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1887
