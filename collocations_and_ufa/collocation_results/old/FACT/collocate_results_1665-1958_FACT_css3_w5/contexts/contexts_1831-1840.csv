conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840

this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840

conjecture is confirmed by the fact that such an embryonic muscular,the,rstl_1840_0025.txt,txt_rstl,1840

this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840

this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840
