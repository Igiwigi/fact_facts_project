Further difficulties arise from the fact that as the new fossil,that,rstb_1913_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1913

results to my own. The fact that individuals can acquire the,that,rstb_1913_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1913
cannot be responsible for the fact that the normal amount of,that,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913
BraveEr’s conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the,that,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913
the sequel that every new fact recorded by us is in,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
and is due to the fact that want of oxygen aids,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

"greatly increased during work, this fact indicating that during natural hyper-",that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
this phenomenon is doubtless the fact that in the smaller bronchioles,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
observations were complicated by the fact that after the exertion there,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
is due firstly to the fact that the normal level of,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
track. VI. Periodic Breathing. The fact that at high altitudes the,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
breathed were vitiated by the fact that the rate of respiratory,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"is essentially due to the fact that the excitation, in so",that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding of,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
very likely account for the fact that the oxygen consumption per,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
an hour. Coupled with the fact that the alteration of the,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
is bound up with the fact that we were taking an,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
condition is shown by the fact that in all of us,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
significant in view of the fact that he has an unusually,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
should be laid upon the fact that neither in ourselves nor,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"amplitude, which accords with the fact that the subject (a telegrapher)",that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
body. Adding to this the fact that the blood volume is,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"Peak, in spite of the fact that the initial oxygen pressure",that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
we take into account the fact that the blood loses a,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
this indirect action is the fact that the lips and faces,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
alkalinity of the blood. The fact that the alkalinity of the,that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"capillaries, we may mention the fact that it seemed to us",that,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
different observers arises from the fact that they are expressed in,that,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
to have arisen from the fact that some of the results,that,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"the exchanger, and to the fact that the distribution of temperature",that,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
formule for other elements. The fact that the series depends in,that,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"A, is due to the fact that except for Ba A",that,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
on the right lines. The fact that ‘014 and ‘0437 are,that,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
of the solid metal. The fact that the terms depend on,that,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
against this allocation is the fact that they do not lie,that,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
a second. Owing to the fact that the mercury in D,that,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913
This is due to the fact that the paths of the,that,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913
support is derived from the fact that the photo-electric effect sets,that,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913
introduce a term expressing the fact that the temperature at any,that,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913
necessary in view of the fact that (13) is obtained according,that,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913
¢ take into account the fact that both the incident and,that,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913

air- temperature records in the fact that the minimum in the,that,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913
beam is proved by the fact that the sensibility of the,that,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"of this, combined with the fact that the inner or carbon",that,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is primarily attributed to the fact that the fluctuations in the,that,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
laid great stress upon the fact that the volwmes of the,that,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
grating spectrum (b) by the fact that the stray light would,that,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913

reasonable in view of the fact that readings concordant within about,that,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
term is shown by the fact that whilst the concordance between,that,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is clearly shown by the fact that the next homologue phenylethyl-carbinol,that,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913

"with changing temperature, but the fact that a volume factor, as",that,rsta_1913_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1913

something to do with the fact that days of large spot,that,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

thus nothing surprising in the fact that the D and H,that,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is borne out by the fact that while the mean percentage,that,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
cannot fail to appreciate the fact that this author has at,that,rstb_1914_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1914

"decimals, in spite of the fact that the measurements, as given",that,rstb_1914_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1914
be partly due to the fact that the chromosomes themselves are,that,rstb_1914_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1914
This is due to the fact that they are in a,that,rstb_1914_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1914
It is rather a curious fact that it has been left,that,rstb_1914_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1914

as a basis and the fact that the ray tracheids have,that,rstb_1914_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1914
have been explained by the fact that the ray tracheids which,that,rstb_1914_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1914

"I must emphasise, therefore, the fact that CARRUTHERS undoubtedly was correctly",that,rstb_1918_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1918

this expansion lies in the fact that the infinite series of,that,rsta_1918_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1918

to be negatived by the fact that different series behave in,that,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918
all four salts. The main fact that these latter ratios indicate,that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918
is admirably illustrated by the fact that both Sthe average and,that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918
"containing those elements. Moreover, the fact that both atomic weight and",that,rsta_1918_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1918
"of the latter, beyond the fact that in some of them",that,rsta_1918_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1918

This is proved by the fact that the Charnian rocks were,that,rsta_1919_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1919

This really arose from the fact that after a large amount,that,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919

important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very,that,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

it is due to the fact that the tidal wave from,that,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920

explanation is found in the fact that the difference between the,in,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

be drawn to a curious fact constantly observed in the material,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921
in several other species. The fact that StiLEs does not figure,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921
by Srizxs lies in the fact that the seeds of the,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921

this vessel lies in the fact that it is undoubtedly homologous,in,rstb_1921_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1921
It differs mainly in the fact that it has a large,in,rstb_1921_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1921
vein. In spite of the fact that its posterior connections are,in,rstb_1921_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1921
condition is shown by the fact that it occurs in the,in,rstb_1921_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1921
these relations lying in the fact that the adjacent cell on,in,rstb_1921_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1921

by convection. There is in fact above the grid a free,in,rsta_1921_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1921
in accordance with the observed fact that when the microphone is,in,rsta_1921_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1921

"the mathematical standpoint, is the fact that the methods which it",is,rsta_1914_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1914
It is easily seen in fact in fig. 2 that the,is,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914
in Table IX. is a fact of somewhat doubtful significance. A,is,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914
matter is indicated by the fact * For this suggestion we,is,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914

conclusion is due to the fact that his observations were almost,is,rstb_1915_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1915
with these estimates is the fact that by far the highest,is,rstb_1915_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1915

one is confronted with the fact that of two groups of,is,rstb_1915_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1915
described as impossible by the fact that there is no primordial,is,rstb_1915_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1915
is to be ascribed the fact that the isophytic line for,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915
is in spite of the fact that our methods of investigation,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915
suggested is based on the fact that early-sown seedlings are much,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915
"rather low, aided by the fact that Giza is rather too",is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915
their first flower- buds. This fact is of primary importance in,is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915
where it is hotter. The fact that all spacings are equally,is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915

"with (44), to recall the fact that ¢ is of the",is,rsta_1915_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1915

with that of THomsen’s formula—in fact the accuracy is greater if,is,rsta_1915_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1915
4 is the further important fact that the potential gradient observations,is,rsta_1915_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1915
is at present possible. The fact that the two falls shown,is,rsta_1915_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1915

is based on the known fact that some oxidising ferments (e.g.,is,rstb_1916_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1916

which is supported by the fact that in Prof. Szeney’s fig.,is,rstb_1916_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1916

described as impossible by the fact that there is no primordial,is,rstb_1915_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1915
is to be ascribed the fact that the isophytic line for,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915
is in spite of the fact that our methods of investigation,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915
suggested is based on the fact that early-sown seedlings are much,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915
"rather low, aided by the fact that Giza is rather too",is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915
their first flower- buds. This fact is of primary importance in,is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915
where it is hotter. The fact that all spacings are equally,is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915
"temperature curve. ‘This is in fact to be expected, for it",is,rsta_1915_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1915

is a question of ascertainable fact whether or not the changes,is,rsta_1915_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1915
of the moon’s transit. The fact that the tide is in,is,rsta_1915_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1915
"with (44), to recall the fact that ¢ is of the",is,rsta_1915_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1915

"separation of carbon, which in fact is never observéd in such",is,rsta_1915_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1915
"re-crystallisation is characterised by the fact that, in the minute crystals",is,rsta_1915_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1915
with that of THomsen’s formula—in fact the accuracy is greater if,is,rsta_1915_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1915
4 is the further important fact that the potential gradient observations,is,rsta_1915_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1915
is at present possible. The fact that the two falls shown,is,rsta_1915_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1915
not for rotational. The remarkable fact is that the rotational term,is,rsta_1915_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1915
"displacement in spite of the fact that it is reversed unsymmetrically,",is,rsta_1915_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1915

coefficient of oxidation. The striking fact is that in a muscle,is,rstb_1916_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1916
is based on the known fact that some oxidising ferments (e.g.,is,rstb_1916_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1916

ETC. 201 One very striking fact is that in the first,is,rstb_1916_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1916

"stand in relation with the fact that here syngamy is absent,",is,rstb_1916_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1916
accounted for. This is the fact that the organella termed kinetonucleus,is,rstb_1916_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1916
which is supported by the fact that in Prof. Szeney’s fig.,is,rstb_1916_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1916
depends very largely on the fact that in Echidna there is,is,rstb_1916_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1916

is in agreement with the fact that the ectobranchial duct is,is,rstb_1916_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1916
is testified to by the fact already set forth that in,is,rstb_1916_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1916

It is not with this fact but with its explanation that,is,rstb_1916_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1916
Introductory. Iv is a curious fact that although our knowledge of,is,rsta_1916_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1916
Matters are complicated by the fact that the broadening is in,is,rsta_1916_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1916

"curve for H,, and in fact of all curves obtained, is",is,rsta_1916_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1916
is confirmed by the above-mentioned fact that differences of 2° C.,is,rsta_1916_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1916
This is due to the fact that as more wrappings are,is,rsta_1916_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1916

"and Parxer, which is in fact the squamosal ; and the",is,rstb_1918_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1918

"however, is due to the fact that more ions are produced",is,rsta_1918_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1918
established fact. It is a fact of some significance. Less accurate,is,rsta_1918_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1918
This is due to the fact that the shorter the wave-length,is,rsta_1918_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1918
of these results is the fact that the central intensities for,is,rsta_1918_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1918

the first. It is in fact definitely reduced. This series behaves,is,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

this is due to the fact that the sea is deep.,is,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920

explanation is found in the fact that the difference between the,is,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

is doubtless due to the fact that the emission from the,from,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914
from the lines themselves. The fact that not all the lines,from,rsta_1914_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1914

"is essentially due to the fact that the excitation, in so",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding of,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

to have arisen from the fact that some of the results,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913

considerably from VS (1). This fact renders the notation of the,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913

reasonable in view of the fact that readings concordant within about,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913

something to do with the fact that days of large spot,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

in the main from the fact already noticed in connection with,the,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914

"steady, as shown by the fact that in subsidiary experiments in",the,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914

may be drawn to the fact that no “ smoothed curves”,the,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914

"the weightier metallic interchange, a fact in full keeping with the",the,rsta_1919_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1919

honour was increased by the fact that I was a pupil,the,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919

This really arose from the fact that after a large amount,the,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919

the interpretation of the above fact of observation seems rather to,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
is probably due to the fact that the wind was blowing,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

"in this situation, and the fact that these in many places",the,rstb_1920_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1920

the explanation lies in the fact that in early germs the,the,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920

with the Tertiary forms.” The fact that fairly complete lineages of,the,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920

true rostro-carinates owing to the fact that they do not possess,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
also drew attention to the fact that from the Pre-Crag Dorsal,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
is necessary to emphasise the fact that the method of preparing,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
well to again emphasise the fact that these seven specimens have,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920

of the author to the fact that the shape of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
IMPLEMENTS stress on the remarkable fact that the symmetry of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
material entirely depends on the fact that it is of different,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
following causes :— 1. The fact that the existing material usually,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
skull mentioned differing in the fact that the frontal is shown,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"distinct from, Eryops. From the fact that the majority of the",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"certain, is shown by the fact that on the right side",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"bone articulates with, may in fact be fused to, the antero-",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"OF THE AMPHIBIA. 45 the fact that it might conceivably, though",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920

view is supported by the fact that the occipitals in the,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"recognised, is shown by the fact that they are often horseshoe-shaped,",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"upper edge, and by the fact that the hemapophyses arise from",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
view is afforded by the fact that narrow clavicles are very,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
the subject in 1912.§ The fact that in this communication Lysorophus,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"the ar ticulare is in fact two bones, the articulare and",the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"is tempered, however, by the fact that the caudal vertebrae have",the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920
other probably connected with the fact that the serpentine _ below,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"appearance, is obvious from the fact that they are present on",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
This is due to the fact that the seventh sternum is,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"larger, owing probably to the fact that the individuals dissected were",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"the examples dissected, and the fact that one worker-like form laid",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

to leave the nest. This fact I have been able to,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"castes, and also for the fact that in many species the",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"hitherto been laid on the fact that, in the majority of",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"or series of mutations. The fact that transitional forms, intermediate in",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

some- what unusual type. The fact that the soldiers also exhibit,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
treatment receives justification from the fact that these various characters are,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
and workers ; (2) the fact that nymphs with well-developed wing,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of “castration parasitaire” is the fact that intestinal Protozoa have sb,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
do not possess. A significant fact is that the ligneous particles,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"through the anus, reveals the fact that Protozoa are present therein.",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
is taken into account the fact that many animals take in,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"point of difference, and the fact that they are few in",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
(1919) draws attention to the fact that the suture of Jndoceras,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
found. A deduction from this fact would suggest that the Exocyclic,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of an Echinoid triad. The fact that the morphoneanic plates at,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
He himself admits the obvious fact that newly-formed ambulacrals are typically,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"and congested a structure, the fact remains that no such irregularity",the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
or phylogenetic argument; but the fact remains that the later AMBULACRUM,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of this phenomenon ; in fact all the evidence shows that,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
discrepancy on account of the fact that G. W. WALKER has,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
= 37; the approximation in fact appears to be better than,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
to be found in the fact that now the stationary value,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations to S, (2)",the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
eclipse was due to the fact that experience in developing the,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
Principe than at Oxford; in fact the focus must have been,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
this must be set the fact that the five stars shown,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
be constant and will in fact be one of the determining,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
this nature and to the fact that the experimental data have.,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"that, in spite of the fact that all the molecules are",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"explanation of this, the following fact is significant. Scapolite cleaves parallel",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
cohesive force lies in the fact that by it-we can readily,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"to other elements, but the fact that departures from the additive",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
the anode pressure preponderates. The fact that for direct current the,the,rsta_1920_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"at 0° C., using the fact that the velocity of H,",the,rsta_1920_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1920

as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
first on account of the fact that it apparently involves more,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
number is counterbalanced by the fact that the dynamical argument ultimately,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
only the restricting conditions. In fact when once these multipliers and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
were it not for the fact that our functions are not,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"magnetic terms, which are in fact analogous with the electrical terms",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
energies. The results are in fact all explicitly independent of any,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
§ 6 agrees with the fact that the material media of,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"and the calculation has in fact been carried out by Larmor,*",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"energies are potential, but the fact that the forces on the",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920

on this special form. In fact it involves the definite assumption,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
for this quantity; and the fact that they all lead to,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"is considerably enhanced by the fact that, in celestial spectra, the",the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

even taking into consideration the fact that the numbers are derived,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
relatively to the second. The fact that 44144 is not visible,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
in order to establish the fact that the phenomenon continued to,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

this phenomenon is doubtless the fact that in the smaller bronchioles,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
observations were complicated by the fact that after the exertion there,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

breathed were vitiated by the fact that the rate of respiratory,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"is essentially due to the fact that the excitation, in so",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding of,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
very likely account for the fact that the oxygen consumption per,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

is bound up with the fact that we were taking an,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
condition is shown by the fact that in all of us,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
significant in view of the fact that he has an unusually,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
should be laid upon the fact that neither in ourselves nor,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

this indirect action is the fact that the lips and faces,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

"nausea, or the like. The fact of the immunity admits of",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
different observers arises from the fact that they are expressed in,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
to have arisen from the fact that some of the results,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913

formule for other elements. The fact that the series depends in,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
considerably from VS (1). This fact renders the notation of the,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"A, is due to the fact that except for Ba A",the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913

This is due to the fact that the paths of the,the,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913
support is derived from the fact that the photo-electric effect sets,the,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913

beam is proved by the fact that the sensibility of the,the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"of this, combined with the fact that the inner or carbon",the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is primarily attributed to the fact that the fluctuations in the,the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913

reasonable in view of the fact that readings concordant within about,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
term is shown by the fact that whilst the concordance between,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is clearly shown by the fact that the next homologue phenylethyl-carbinol,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"see that the somewhat remarkable fact that two functions w, y",the,rsta_1913_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1913

something to do with the fact that days of large spot,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

thus nothing surprising in the fact that the D and H,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is borne out by the fact that while the mean percentage,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914

This really arose from the fact that after a large amount,the,rsta_1919_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1919
neglect. It seems an unfortunate fact that the efforts of magneticians,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
"theory, partly owing to the fact that the results of their",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
"than the 24-hour component, a fact which has an interesting bearing",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
factor (R/r)” allows for the fact that the magnetic variations are,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
"Even as it is, the fact that the harmonic Q,~' will",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
into our theoretical calculations. Another fact worth noting is that the,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
the interpretation of the above fact of observation seems rather to,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
is probably due to the fact that the frequency is governed,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

BE In view of the fact that the sound-waves in the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
is diminished owing to the fact that differential readings of temperature,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

to be due to the fact that conditions are so adjusted,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
of discontinuity taking place. The fact that in a siren the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
"pressure amplitudes, owing to the fact that in the latter case",the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
not determinate owing to the fact that the face opposite the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
is probably due to the fact that the wind was blowing,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
by [aW/af)=l8p[f(2qm). ee Expressing the fact that the entire flow of,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
temperature is indicated by the fact that there is no further,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919
This error lies in the fact that some of the air,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919
safeguard is provided by the fact that in experiments where there,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919

large error owing to the fact that the connecting tubes (and,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919

other part of London. The fact that this epidemic is confined,the,rstb_1920_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"in this situation, and the fact that these in many places",the,rstb_1920_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1920

enamel is shown by the fact that it is 310 DR.,the,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920
the explanation lies in the fact that in early germs the,the,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920
he drew attention to the fact that specimens of Nasmyth’s Membrane,the,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"Pachydera, Murinopsia and Decurtaria, in fact the EVOLUTION OF A GROUP",the,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920

with the Tertiary forms.” The fact that fairly complete lineages of,the,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920

true rostro-carinates owing to the fact that they do not possess,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
also drew attention to the fact that from the Pre-Crag Dorsal,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
is necessary to emphasise the fact that the method of preparing,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
well to again emphasise the fact that these seven specimens have,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
flint. As a matter of fact the point C may be,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of the author to the fact that the shape of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
IMPLEMENTS stress on the remarkable fact that the symmetry of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
material entirely depends on the fact that it is of different,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
following causes :— 1. The fact that the existing material usually,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
skull mentioned differing in the fact that the frontal is shown,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"distinct from, Eryops. From the fact that the majority of the",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"bone articulates with, may in fact be fused to, the antero-",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"OF THE AMPHIBIA. 45 the fact that it might conceivably, though",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920

view is supported by the fact that the occipitals in the,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"recognised, is shown by the fact that they are often horseshoe-shaped,",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"upper edge, and by the fact that the hemapophyses arise from",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
view is afforded by the fact that narrow clavicles are very,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
the subject in 1912.§ The fact that in this communication Lysorophus,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"the ar ticulare is in fact two bones, the articulare and",the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920
Amblystoma make mention of the fact that on the right side,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"is tempered, however, by the fact that the caudal vertebrae have",the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920
other probably connected with the fact that the serpentine _ below,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"appearance, is obvious from the fact that they are present on",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
This is due to the fact that the seventh sternum is,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"larger, owing probably to the fact that the individuals dissected were",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"the examples dissected, and the fact that one worker-like form laid",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"in mind that, notwithstanding the fact that the larvee are hatched",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
to leave the nest. This fact I have been able to,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"castes, and also for the fact that in many species the",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"hitherto been laid on the fact that, in the majority of",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"or series of mutations. The fact that transitional forms, intermediate in",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"size, probably owing to the fact that the worker-like forms are",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
some- what unusual type. The fact that the soldiers also exhibit,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
treatment receives justification from the fact that these various characters are,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
and workers ; (2) the fact that nymphs with well-developed wing,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of “castration parasitaire” is the fact that intestinal Protozoa have sb,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
do not possess. A significant fact is that the ligneous particles,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"through the anus, reveals the fact that Protozoa are present therein.",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
is taken into account the fact that many animals take in,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"point of difference, and the fact that they are few in",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
(1919) draws attention to the fact that the suture of Jndoceras,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
found. A deduction from this fact would suggest that the Exocyclic,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of an Echinoid triad. The fact that the morphoneanic plates at,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
He himself admits the obvious fact that newly-formed ambulacrals are typically,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"and congested a structure, the fact remains that no such irregularity",the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
or phylogenetic argument; but the fact remains that the later AMBULACRUM,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of this phenomenon ; in fact all the evidence shows that,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
discrepancy on account of the fact that G. W. WALKER has,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
= 37; the approximation in fact appears to be better than,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
to be found in the fact that now the stationary value,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations to S, (2)",the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
eclipse was due to the fact that experience in developing the,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
Principe than at Oxford; in fact the focus must have been,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
this must be set the fact that the five stars shown,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
be constant and will in fact be one of the determining,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"that, in spite of the fact that all the molecules are",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"explanation of this, the following fact is significant. Scapolite cleaves parallel",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
cohesive force lies in the fact that by it-we can readily,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"possess is due to the fact that, with the largest magnetic",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"to other elements, but the fact that departures from the additive",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
the anode pressure preponderates. The fact that for direct current the,the,rsta_1920_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"at 0° C., using the fact that the velocity of H,",the,rsta_1920_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1920

as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
first on account of the fact that it apparently involves more,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
number is counterbalanced by the fact that the dynamical argument ultimately,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
only the restricting conditions. In fact when once these multipliers and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
were it not for the fact that our functions are not,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"magnetic terms, which are in fact analogous with the electrical terms",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
energies. The results are in fact all explicitly independent of any,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
§ 6 agrees with the fact that the material media of,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"and the calculation has in fact been carried out by Larmor,*",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"energies are potential, but the fact that the forces on the",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"and accurate, and that in fact in agreement with the results",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
on this special form. In fact it involves the definite assumption,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
for this quantity; and the fact that they all lead to,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
probably exist and are in fact of precisely the correct type.,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
then best described by the fact that the action integral b,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
and vector potentials ; in fact from the third we have,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
was desired to emphasise the fact that the theory in its,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"is considerably enhanced by the fact that, in celestial spectra, the",the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
interest in view of the fact that it is in this,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
even taking into consideration the fact that the numbers are derived,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
relatively to the second. The fact that 44144 is not visible,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
in order to establish the fact that the phenomenon continued to,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

Comparing this investigation with the fact of the existence of an,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

the first. It is in fact definitely reduced. This series behaves,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

the necessity of verifying the fact that the Sharp series of,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
the mixture are comparable. In fact in a comparable mixture of,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
relatively to the Diffuse series—in fact the intensity is doubled—and a,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"the eddies, which can in fact be seen marking the surface",the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
this is due to the fact that the sea is deep.,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"is probably due to the. fact that, at the times the",the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920

to modifications introduced by the fact that the channel has not,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
it is due to the fact that the tidal wave from,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920

explanation is found in the fact that the difference between the,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

the sequel that every new fact recorded by us is in,is,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

this phenomenon is doubtless the fact that in the smaller bronchioles,is,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

"were to be expected, the fact that the grandparental coefficient is",is,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914
constitutions is indicated by the fact that the correlation between individuals,is,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914
was throughout genotypically uniform. The fact that purely somatic fluctuation is,is,rstb_1914_0020.txt,txt_rstb,1914
is borne out by the fact that very few survive more,is,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914
This is supported by the fact that hybrids between these two,is,rstb_1914_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1914

forms. This is notwithstanding the fact that in having large yolky,is,rstb_1914_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1914

It is easily seen in fact in fig. 2 that the,is,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914
in Table IX. is a fact of somewhat doubtful significance. A,is,rsta_1914_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1914
matter is indicated by the fact * For this suggestion we,is,rsta_1914_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1914

with these estimates is the fact that by far the highest,is,rstb_1915_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1915

may call attention to the fact that (though this species is,is,rstb_1915_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1915
one is confronted with the fact that of two groups of,is,rstb_1915_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1915
described as impossible by the fact that there is no primordial,is,rstb_1915_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1915

is in spite of the fact that our methods of investigation,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915
suggested is based on the fact that early-sown seedlings are much,is,rstb_1915_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1915
"rather low, aided by the fact that Giza is rather too",is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915
their first flower- buds. This fact is of primary importance in,is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915
where it is hotter. The fact that all spacings are equally,is,rstb_1915_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1915

"with (44), to recall the fact that ¢ is of the",is,rsta_1915_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1915

with that of THomsen’s formula—in fact the accuracy is greater if,is,rsta_1915_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1915
4 is the further important fact that the potential gradient observations,is,rsta_1915_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1915
is at present possible. The fact that the two falls shown,is,rsta_1915_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1915

is based on the known fact that some oxidising ferments (e.g.,is,rstb_1916_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1916

which is supported by the fact that in Prof. Szeney’s fig.,is,rstb_1916_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1916

Further difficulties arise from the fact that as the new fossil,the,rstb_1913_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1913

this kind of observation. The fact that the divisions are so,the,rstb_1913_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"I imagine, owing to the fact that the interest has been",the,rstb_1913_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1913

results to my own. The fact that individuals can acquire the,the,rstb_1913_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1913
cannot be responsible for the fact that the normal amount of,the,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913
BraveEr’s conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the,the,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913
the sequel that every new fact recorded by us is in,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
and is due to the fact that want of oxygen aids,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"drawing a single breath.{ The fact that, besides atmospheric pressure, other",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

as probably due to the fact that the oxygen percentage in,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
this phenomenon is doubtless the fact that in the smaller bronchioles,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
observations were complicated by the fact that after the exertion there,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
is due firstly to the fact that the normal level of,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

breathed were vitiated by the fact that the rate of respiratory,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"is essentially due to the fact that the excitation, in so",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding of,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
very likely account for the fact that the oxygen consumption per,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
an hour. Coupled with the fact that the alteration of the,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
is bound up with the fact that we were taking an,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
condition is shown by the fact that in all of us,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
significant in view of the fact that he has an unusually,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
should be laid upon the fact that neither in ourselves nor,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

"were in the blood, this fact should be remembered. All the",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

"Peak, in spite of the fact that the initial oxygen pressure",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
we take into account the fact that the blood loses a,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
this indirect action is the fact that the lips and faces,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
alkalinity of the blood. The fact that the alkalinity of the,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"capillaries, we may mention the fact that it seemed to us",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"nausea, or the like. The fact of the immunity admits of",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
different observers arises from the fact that they are expressed in,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
to have arisen from the fact that some of the results,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"the exchanger, and to the fact that the distribution of temperature",the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
formule for other elements. The fact that the series depends in,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
considerably from VS (1). This fact renders the notation of the,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"A, is due to the fact that except for Ba A",the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
on the right lines. The fact that ‘014 and ‘0437 are,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913

against this allocation is the fact that they do not lie,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913

This is due to the fact that the paths of the,the,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913
support is derived from the fact that the photo-electric effect sets,the,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913
introduce a term expressing the fact that the temperature at any,the,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913

"satisfactory, in spite of the fact that the mean values of",the,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913
air- temperature records in the fact that the minimum in the,the,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913
beam is proved by the fact that the sensibility of the,the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"of this, combined with the fact that the inner or carbon",the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is primarily attributed to the fact that the fluctuations in the,the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
laid great stress upon the fact that the volwmes of the,the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913

reasonable in view of the fact that readings concordant within about,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
term is shown by the fact that whilst the concordance between,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is clearly shown by the fact that the next homologue phenylethyl-carbinol,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"see that the somewhat remarkable fact that two functions w, y",the,rsta_1913_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1913
that these numbers are in fact the same as those found,the,rsta_1913_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1913
the trigonometrical calculation does in fact bring in no terms of,the,rsta_1913_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1913

"with changing temperature, but the fact that a volume factor, as",the,rsta_1913_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1913

something to do with the fact that days of large spot,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"as a whole, and the fact that the apparent sunspot influence",the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

more short of this. The fact reminded me of Prof. Scuuster’s,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"were mainly due to the fact that two outstanding ranges, respectively",the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

thus nothing surprising in the fact that the D and H,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is borne out by the fact that while the mean percentage,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
cannot fail to appreciate the fact that this author has at,the,rstb_1914_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1914

conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914
is doubtless due to the fact that the emission from the,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914

"than the 24-hour component, a fact which has an interesting bearing",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919

"Even as it is, the fact that the harmonic Q,~' will",the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919

the interpretation of the above fact of observation seems rather to,the,rsta_1919_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1919
important results arising from the fact that waves of small amplitude,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

is well illustrated by the fact that when the high note,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
is diminished owing to the fact that differential readings of temperature,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

to be due to the fact that conditions are so adjusted,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
of discontinuity taking place. The fact that in a siren the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
"pressure amplitudes, owing to the fact that in the latter case",the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
not determinate owing to the fact that the face opposite the,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
is probably due to the fact that the wind was blowing,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919
by [aW/af)=l8p[f(2qm). ee Expressing the fact that the entire flow of,the,rsta_1919_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1919

This error lies in the fact that some of the air,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919
safeguard is provided by the fact that in experiments where there,the,rsta_1919_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1919

"in this situation, and the fact that these in many places",the,rstb_1920_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1920

the explanation lies in the fact that in early germs the,the,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"Pachydera, Murinopsia and Decurtaria, in fact the EVOLUTION OF A GROUP",the,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920

with the Tertiary forms.” The fact that fairly complete lineages of,the,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920

well to again emphasise the fact that these seven specimens have,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920

of the author to the fact that the shape of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
IMPLEMENTS stress on the remarkable fact that the symmetry of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
material entirely depends on the fact that it is of different,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
following causes :— 1. The fact that the existing material usually,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
skull mentioned differing in the fact that the frontal is shown,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"distinct from, Eryops. From the fact that the majority of the",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"bone articulates with, may in fact be fused to, the antero-",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"OF THE AMPHIBIA. 45 the fact that it might conceivably, though",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920

view is supported by the fact that the occipitals in the,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"recognised, is shown by the fact that they are often horseshoe-shaped,",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"upper edge, and by the fact that the hemapophyses arise from",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
view is afforded by the fact that narrow clavicles are very,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
the subject in 1912.§ The fact that in this communication Lysorophus,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"the ar ticulare is in fact two bones, the articulare and",the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"is tempered, however, by the fact that the caudal vertebrae have",the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920
other probably connected with the fact that the serpentine _ below,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"appearance, is obvious from the fact that they are present on",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
This is due to the fact that the seventh sternum is,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"larger, owing probably to the fact that the individuals dissected were",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"the examples dissected, and the fact that one worker-like form laid",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

to leave the nest. This fact I have been able to,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"castes, and also for the fact that in many species the",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"or series of mutations. The fact that transitional forms, intermediate in",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"size, probably owing to the fact that the worker-like forms are",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
some- what unusual type. The fact that the soldiers also exhibit,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
treatment receives justification from the fact that these various characters are,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
and workers ; (2) the fact that nymphs with well-developed wing,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of “castration parasitaire” is the fact that intestinal Protozoa have sb,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
do not possess. A significant fact is that the ligneous particles,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"through the anus, reveals the fact that Protozoa are present therein.",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
is taken into account the fact that many animals take in,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"point of difference, and the fact that they are few in",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
(1919) draws attention to the fact that the suture of Jndoceras,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920

of an Echinoid triad. The fact that the morphoneanic plates at,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
He himself admits the obvious fact that newly-formed ambulacrals are typically,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"and congested a structure, the fact remains that no such irregularity",the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
or phylogenetic argument; but the fact remains that the later AMBULACRUM,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of this phenomenon ; in fact all the evidence shows that,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
discrepancy on account of the fact that G. W. WALKER has,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
= 37; the approximation in fact appears to be better than,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
to be found in the fact that now the stationary value,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations to S, (2)",the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
eclipse was due to the fact that experience in developing the,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
Principe than at Oxford; in fact the focus must have been,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
this must be set the fact that the five stars shown,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
be constant and will in fact be one of the determining,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"that, in spite of the fact that all the molecules are",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"explanation of this, the following fact is significant. Scapolite cleaves parallel",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
cohesive force lies in the fact that by it-we can readily,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"possess is due to the fact that, with the largest magnetic",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"to other elements, but the fact that departures from the additive",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
the anode pressure preponderates. The fact that for direct current the,the,rsta_1920_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1920

as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
first on account of the fact that it apparently involves more,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
number is counterbalanced by the fact that the dynamical argument ultimately,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
only the restricting conditions. In fact when once these multipliers and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
were it not for the fact that our functions are not,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"magnetic terms, which are in fact analogous with the electrical terms",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
energies. The results are in fact all explicitly independent of any,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
§ 6 agrees with the fact that the material media of,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"and the calculation has in fact been carried out by Larmor,*",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"energies are potential, but the fact that the forces on the",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"and accurate, and that in fact in agreement with the results",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
on this special form. In fact it involves the definite assumption,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
for this quantity; and the fact that they all lead to,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920

then best described by the fact that the action integral b,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
and vector potentials ; in fact from the third we have,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
was desired to emphasise the fact that the theory in its,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"is considerably enhanced by the fact that, in celestial spectra, the",the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
interest in view of the fact that it is in this,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
even taking into consideration the fact that the numbers are derived,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
relatively to the second. The fact that 44144 is not visible,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
in order to establish the fact that the phenomenon continued to,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

the first. It is in fact definitely reduced. This series behaves,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

the necessity of verifying the fact that the Sharp series of,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
the mixture are comparable. In fact in a comparable mixture of,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
relatively to the Diffuse series—in fact the intensity is doubled—and a,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"the eddies, which can in fact be seen marking the surface",the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
this is due to the fact that the sea is deep.,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"is probably due to the. fact that, at the times the",the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920

to modifications introduced by the fact that the channel has not,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
it is due to the fact that the tidal wave from,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920

explanation is found in the fact that the difference between the,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

obtainable by chemical methods. In fact the question is raised as,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

the subject lies in the fact that it is the only,the,rsta_1922_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1922

Further difficulties arise from the fact that as the new fossil,the,rstb_1913_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1913
also acknowledge with thanks the fact that some of the expenses,the,rstb_1913_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1913
involved. In view of the fact that the vertical distance between,the,rstb_1913_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1913

"of the body, and the fact that, as the attitude in",the,rstb_1913_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1913

this kind of observation. The fact that the divisions are so,the,rstb_1913_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1913

results to my own. The fact that individuals can acquire the,the,rstb_1913_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1913
cannot be responsible for the fact that the normal amount of,the,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913
BraveEr’s conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the,the,rstb_1913_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1913
the sequel that every new fact recorded by us is in,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
and is due to the fact that want of oxygen aids,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

as probably due to the fact that the oxygen percentage in,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
this phenomenon is doubtless the fact that in the smaller bronchioles,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
observations were complicated by the fact that after the exertion there,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
is due firstly to the fact that the normal level of,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

breathed were vitiated by the fact that the rate of respiratory,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"is essentially due to the fact that the excitation, in so",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding of,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
very likely account for the fact that the oxygen consumption per,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
an hour. Coupled with the fact that the alteration of the,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
is bound up with the fact that we were taking an,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
condition is shown by the fact that in all of us,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
significant in view of the fact that he has an unusually,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
should be laid upon the fact that neither in ourselves nor,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

"Peak, in spite of the fact that the initial oxygen pressure",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
we take into account the fact that the blood loses a,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
this indirect action is the fact that the lips and faces,the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913

"capillaries, we may mention the fact that it seemed to us",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
"nausea, or the like. The fact of the immunity admits of",the,rstb_1913_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1913
different observers arises from the fact that they are expressed in,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
to have arisen from the fact that some of the results,the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"the exchanger, and to the fact that the distribution of temperature",the,rsta_1913_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1913
formule for other elements. The fact that the series depends in,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
considerably from VS (1). This fact renders the notation of the,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"A, is due to the fact that except for Ba A",the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913

against this allocation is the fact that they do not lie,the,rsta_1913_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1913

This is due to the fact that the paths of the,the,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913
support is derived from the fact that the photo-electric effect sets,the,rsta_1913_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1913
introduce a term expressing the fact that the temperature at any,the,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913

"satisfactory, in spite of the fact that the mean values of",the,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913
air- temperature records in the fact that the minimum in the,the,rsta_1913_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1913
beam is proved by the fact that the sensibility of the,the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"of this, combined with the fact that the inner or carbon",the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is primarily attributed to the fact that the fluctuations in the,the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913
laid great stress upon the fact that the volwmes of the,the,rsta_1913_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1913

reasonable in view of the fact that readings concordant within about,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
term is shown by the fact that whilst the concordance between,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is clearly shown by the fact that the next homologue phenylethyl-carbinol,the,rsta_1913_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"see that the somewhat remarkable fact that two functions w, y",the,rsta_1913_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1913

the trigonometrical calculation does in fact bring in no terms of,the,rsta_1913_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1913

something to do with the fact that days of large spot,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

"different stations vary, and the fact that the scale of values",the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

more short of this. The fact reminded me of Prof. Scuuster’s,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
"were mainly due to the fact that two outstanding ranges, respectively",the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913

thus nothing surprising in the fact that the D and H,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
is borne out by the fact that while the mean percentage,the,rsta_1913_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1913
cannot fail to appreciate the fact that this author has at,the,rstb_1914_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1914
"one another, owing to the fact that the processes are local",the,rstb_1914_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1914

we could obtain. The one fact which does stand out clearly,the,rstb_1914_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1914
"low temperatures, discovered the important fact that the chromosomes of cells",the,rstb_1914_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1914

This is due to the fact that they are in a,the,rstb_1914_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1914

conclusion is supported by the fact that an increased emission occurs,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914
is doubtless due to the fact that the emission from the,the,rsta_1914_0019.txt,txt_rsta,1914

the explanation lies in the fact that in early germs the,the,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920
he drew attention to the fact that specimens of Nasmyth’s Membrane,the,rstb_1920_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"Pachydera, Murinopsia and Decurtaria, in fact the EVOLUTION OF A GROUP",the,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920

with the Tertiary forms.” The fact that fairly complete lineages of,the,rstb_1920_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1920

true rostro-carinates owing to the fact that they do not possess,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
also drew attention to the fact that from the Pre-Crag Dorsal,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
is necessary to emphasise the fact that the method of preparing,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
well to again emphasise the fact that these seven specimens have,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920

of the author to the fact that the shape of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
IMPLEMENTS stress on the remarkable fact that the symmetry of the,the,rstb_1920_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1920
material entirely depends on the fact that it is of different,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
following causes :— 1. The fact that the existing material usually,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
skull mentioned differing in the fact that the frontal is shown,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"distinct from, Eryops. From the fact that the majority of the",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"bone articulates with, may in fact be fused to, the antero-",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"OF THE AMPHIBIA. 45 the fact that it might conceivably, though",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920

view is supported by the fact that the occipitals in the,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"recognised, is shown by the fact that they are often horseshoe-shaped,",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"upper edge, and by the fact that the hemapophyses arise from",the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
view is afforded by the fact that narrow clavicles are very,the,rstb_1920_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1920
the subject in 1912.§ The fact that in this communication Lysorophus,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920

other probably connected with the fact that the serpentine _ below,the,rstb_1920_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"appearance, is obvious from the fact that they are present on",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
This is due to the fact that the seventh sternum is,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"larger, owing probably to the fact that the individuals dissected were",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"the examples dissected, and the fact that one worker-like form laid",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

to leave the nest. This fact I have been able to,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"castes, and also for the fact that in many species the",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"or series of mutations. The fact that transitional forms, intermediate in",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"size, probably owing to the fact that the worker-like forms are",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
some- what unusual type. The fact that the soldiers also exhibit,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
treatment receives justification from the fact that these various characters are,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
and workers ; (2) the fact that nymphs with well-developed wing,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of “castration parasitaire” is the fact that intestinal Protozoa have sb,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
do not possess. A significant fact is that the ligneous particles,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"through the anus, reveals the fact that Protozoa are present therein.",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
is taken into account the fact that many animals take in,the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920

"point of difference, and the fact that they are few in",the,rstb_1920_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1920
(1919) draws attention to the fact that the suture of Jndoceras,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
found. A deduction from this fact would suggest that the Exocyclic,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of an Echinoid triad. The fact that the morphoneanic plates at,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
He himself admits the obvious fact that newly-formed ambulacrals are typically,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
"and congested a structure, the fact remains that no such irregularity",the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
or phylogenetic argument; but the fact remains that the later AMBULACRUM,the,rstb_1920_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1920
of this phenomenon ; in fact all the evidence shows that,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
discrepancy on account of the fact that G. W. WALKER has,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
= 37; the approximation in fact appears to be better than,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
to be found in the fact that now the stationary value,the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations to S, (2)",the,rsta_1920_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1920
eclipse was due to the fact that experience in developing the,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
Principe than at Oxford; in fact the focus must have been,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
this must be set the fact that the five stars shown,the,rsta_1920_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1920
be constant and will in fact be one of the determining,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"that, in spite of the fact that all the molecules are",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"explanation of this, the following fact is significant. Scapolite cleaves parallel",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
cohesive force lies in the fact that by it-we can readily,the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"possess is due to the fact that, with the largest magnetic",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"to other elements, but the fact that departures from the additive",the,rsta_1920_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1920
the anode pressure preponderates. The fact that for direct current the,the,rsta_1920_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"at 0° C., using the fact that the velocity of H,",the,rsta_1920_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1920

as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
first on account of the fact that it apparently involves more,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
number is counterbalanced by the fact that the dynamical argument ultimately,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
only the restricting conditions. In fact when once these multipliers and,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
were it not for the fact that our functions are not,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"magnetic terms, which are in fact analogous with the electrical terms",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
energies. The results are in fact all explicitly independent of any,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
§ 6 agrees with the fact that the material media of,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"and the calculation has in fact been carried out by Larmor,*",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"energies are potential, but the fact that the forces on the",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"and accurate, and that in fact in agreement with the results",the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
on this special form. In fact it involves the definite assumption,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
for this quantity; and the fact that they all lead to,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920

then best described by the fact that the action integral b,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920

was desired to emphasise the fact that the theory in its,the,rsta_1920_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"is considerably enhanced by the fact that, in celestial spectra, the",the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
interest in view of the fact that it is in this,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
even taking into consideration the fact that the numbers are derived,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
relatively to the second. The fact that 44144 is not visible,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
in order to establish the fact that the phenomenon continued to,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920

the necessity of verifying the fact that the Sharp series of,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
the mixture are comparable. In fact in a comparable mixture of,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
relatively to the Diffuse series—in fact the intensity is doubled—and a,the,rsta_1920_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"the eddies, which can in fact be seen marking the surface",the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
this is due to the fact that the sea is deep.,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
"is probably due to the. fact that, at the times the",the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920

to modifications introduced by the fact that the channel has not,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920
it is due to the fact that the tidal wave from,the,rsta_1920_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1920

"observed region, and as a fact the corresponding line is found",the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920
explanation is found in the fact that the difference between the,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920
explana- tion accounts for the fact that the F separations are,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

obtainable by chemical methods. In fact the question is raised as,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

as on the limit. In fact a similar phenomenon is indicated,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

may be due to the fact that the line taken for,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920
refer to real relationship. In fact there are cases where the,the,rsta_1920_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1920

be drawn to a curious fact constantly observed in the material,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921
in several other species. The fact that StiLEs does not figure,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921
by Srizxs lies in the fact that the seeds of the,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921

"leaves of Cordaites, and in fact the leaves of any known",in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921
this vessel lies in the fact that it is undoubtedly homologous,in,rstb_1921_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1921

vein. In spite of the fact that its posterior connections are,in,rstb_1921_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1921
condition is shown by the fact that it occurs in the,in,rstb_1921_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1921
these relations lying in the fact that the adjacent cell on,in,rstb_1921_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1921

by convection. There is in fact above the grid a free,in,rsta_1921_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1921

be drawn to a curious fact constantly observed in the material,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921
in several other species. The fact that StiLEs does not figure,in,rstb_1921_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1921
