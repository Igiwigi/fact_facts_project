impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939

Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939

not agree with the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939
One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940
necessary to re-examine both the facts and the lines of reasoning.,the,rstb_1940_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1940
the presence of Trias. These facts strongly suggest that the Lower,the,rsta_1940_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1940

"required for melanin formation, the facts support the idea that we",the,rstb_1941_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1941

an explanation for several peculiar facts about the activities of young,the,rstb_1942_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1942
(146). We note the following facts : TueoreM XXIV.—Under a purely,the,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933

"statistical practice, when the observed facts are described as “‘ samples,”",the,rsta_1933_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1933
view. The explanation of these facts is seen in the slender,the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934
OF THE CEREBRUM. Despite these facts it seems improbable that this,the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934
"parieto-occipitalis is, if the above facts are valid, the upper end",the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934
to overlook the many interesting facts concerning colour change in this,the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934
pallor. In view of these facts no general statement concerning the,the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934
of this mechanism the following facts must be considered : (a),the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934
"Fig. 3 reveals the remarkable facts that DH, and DHy may",the,rstb_1934_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1934

one of the most interesting facts elucidated by Hayek (1924) is,the,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934
nature. ‘Taking into account the facts that the fifth nerve already,the,rstb_1934_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1934
