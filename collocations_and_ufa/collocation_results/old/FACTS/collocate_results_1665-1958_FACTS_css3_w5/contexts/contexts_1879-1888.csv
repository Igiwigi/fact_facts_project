the interest attaching to these facts arises from the bearing which,these,rstl_1880_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1880

the one most accordant with facts or not. That the discontinuous,the,rstl_1879_0062.txt,txt_rstl,1879
is nothing antagonistic to known facts in the assumption that the,the,rstl_1879_0062.txt,txt_rstl,1879
