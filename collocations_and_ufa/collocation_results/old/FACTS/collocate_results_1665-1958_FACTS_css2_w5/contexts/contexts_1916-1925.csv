to put upon the above facts seems to be the following,the,rstb_1923_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1923,12
such general accordance with the facts should have sprung to birth,the,rsta_1923_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1923,12
"qualitative descrip- tion of the facts observed. When, however, the observations",the,rsta_1923_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1923,12

we cannot account for the facts observed on this theory if,the,rsta_1923_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1923,12
the load is decreased. These facts have an important bearing on,the,rsta_1923_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1923,12
at above. From all these facts the conclusion may be drawn,the,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923,12
of temperature. Hence the preceding facts may be summarised as follows:,the,rsta_1923_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1923,12
just described establish the following facts :— 1. That the specialised,the,rstb_1924_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1924,12
"of Trachinus draco, establishes the facts that the venom is both",the,rstb_1924_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1924,12

"the main xylem ring), other facts have come to light which",the,rstb_1924_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1924,12
arisen by mutation. From the facts which research upon isolated stocks,the,rstb_1924_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1924,12
"is concerned, With the main facts in hand, it appears that",the,rstb_1924_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1924,12
"is evident that, if the facts are as I have stated",the,rstb_1924_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1924,12

In view of the foregoing facts it would seem worth while,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925,12
lies not only in the facts that for a fine division,the,rstb_1925_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1925,12

"slightly closer representation of the facts ; at all events, a",the,rstb_1925_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1925,12

"So far as the available facts go, it is not impossible",the,rstb_1925_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1925,12

"instructive section, of which the facts recorded in our note books",the,rstb_1925_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1925,12

production of the megasporophylls. These facts seem to further strengthen the,the,rstb_1916_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1916,12
on the following : two facts :— ¢ * 1. That,the,rstb_1916_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1916,12

connection the bearing of the facts above set forth on the,the,rstb_1916_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1916,12
we prefer to regard the facts above set forth as affording,the,rstb_1916_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1916,12
a complex basketwork. These chief facts are illustrated in the 5,the,rstb_1916_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1916,12
and important of all the facts brought to light by this,the,rsta_1916_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1916,12

"our theory to represent the facts in these extreme cases, the",the,rsta_1916_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1916,12
epidemic is the result. The facts thus suggest the existence of,the,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,12
or are explained by the facts observed in other places. The,the,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,12
is greater than 600. The facts just described throw considerable light,the,rstb_1918_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1918,12
