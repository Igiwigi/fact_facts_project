races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,20
this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work of,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,20

observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,20
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,20
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,20

It is thought that the facts here recorded will be of,is,rstb_1934_0018.txt,txt_rstb,1934,20

is at variance with the facts of development. In the first,is,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934,20
"is in accord with the facts because, as has already been",is,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934,20
; an explanation of the facts is put forward. The meteorological,is,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934,20
is one of the basic facts in the study of hair,is,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934,20
This is confirmed by the facts recorded in a previous study,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935,20
"is in agreement with the facts observed by von Kocu (1882,",is,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936,20

races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,20

"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,20

observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,20
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,20
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,20

In the light of the facts presented above it would appear,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,20
