impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939

view. The explanation of these facts is seen in the slender,the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934
