to suggest that the nasal facts may have been situated in,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,23

brain mentioned above. When the facts concerning the medial occipital region,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,23
inferior is definitely established. The facts become striking by comparing the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,23
harmony with the above. Two facts so far stand out :,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,23
races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,23
this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work of,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,23
any apical system known. The facts seem to be that these,the,rstb_1938_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1938,23
"partial survival may occur, the facts indicate that the oviposition response",the,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1938,23

independent of mitotic activity. The facts so far recorded relating to,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,23
the living and non-living. The facts are there: we must adjust,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,23

"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,23

the direction of Montserrat. These facts taken together suggest that the,the,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,23
one of the most far-reaching facts with which modern cytology has,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
"in the discussion, but no facts have so far been found",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
In the light of the facts presented above it would appear,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
here to account for the facts of chromosome elasticity. It should,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
possible the validity of the facts which have been used. This,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23
seemed profitable to publish the facts as they stand in the,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,23

"here included, however, establishes the facts more definitely. The last row",the,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,23
One of the most striking facts which emerge is that when,the,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,23
Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,23
particularly successful in correlating the facts when a liquid passes to,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,23
"sufficient to represent the observed facts with high accuracy, so that",the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,23
not agree with the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,23
One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,23
to suggest that the nasal facts may have been situated in,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,23
necessary to re-examine both the facts and the lines of reasoning.,the,rstb_1940_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1940,23
the presence of Trias. These facts strongly suggest that the Lower,the,rsta_1940_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1940,23

"required for melanin formation, the facts support the idea that we",the,rstb_1941_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1941,23
in small sori. The pollen facts are shaped as in the,the,rstb_1941_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1941,23
noticed. The sporangia are finger-shaped facts about 1-2 x 0-7 mm.;,the,rstb_1941_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1941,23

view. The explanation of these facts is seen in the slender,the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23
OF THE CEREBRUM. Despite these facts it seems improbable that this,the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23
"parieto-occipitalis is, if the above facts are valid, the upper end",the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23
to overlook the many interesting facts concerning colour change in this,the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23
pallor. In view of these facts no general statement concerning the,the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23
of this mechanism the following facts must be considered : (a),the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23
"Fig. 3 reveals the remarkable facts that DH, and DHy may",the,rstb_1934_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23

Marsuauti. The recognition of these facts adds particular importance to the,the,rstb_1934_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23
feature on the vertex. These facts are very clearly demonstrated in,the,rstb_1934_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1934,23
