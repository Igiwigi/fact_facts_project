were actually produced. And similar facts are to be found in,are,rstb_1887_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1887,22
points are demonstrated by the facts just described : the sporangia,are,rstb_1888_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1888,22
"totally different. Indeed, beyond the facts that they are both Hydrozoa",are,rstb_1888_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1888,22
commences. For this reason the facts are best grouped together according,are,rstb_1888_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1888,22
VII—MISCELLANEOUS FACTS. There are several facts of general interest which have,are,rstb_1888_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1888,22
"question is impossible before the facts of development are known, I",are,rstb_1888_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1888,22
this nomenclature ; and the facts above related are strongly in,are,rstb_1888_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1888,22
show (1) that all the facts are comprised in the statement,are,rstb_1888_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1888,22
"identifies it. Happily, though some facts relating to the subject are",are,rstb_1888_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1888,22
B negative (minor phase). The facts of experiment are in complete,are,rstb_1889_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1889,22
"one, but there are certain facts somewhat in favour of it.",are,rstb_1889_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1889,22
; but there are some facts in the foregoing experiments bearing,are,rstb_1889_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1889,22
"a great extent, the same facts and arguments are applicable in",are,rstb_1889_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1889,22
to believe that the above facts are quite sufficient to render,are,rstb_1889_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1889,22
"well established; and that thus facts of vegetable production are explained,",are,rstb_1889_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1889,22
was obliterated. Therefore there are facts which seem to point to,are,rstb_1889_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1889,22
the lower limb region. These facts are simply examples of the,are,rstb_1890_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1890,22
Calamarian affinities suggested by these facts are further supported by the,are,rstb_1891_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1891,22
Graphic representations of the same facts are given in Plates 6,are,rstb_1891_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1891,22

beat of the base. These facts show that direct compression of,that,rstl_1882_0024.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
that an enormous mass of facts in connexion with the action,that,rstl_1882_0024.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
but also as to observed facts connected with that action. The,that,rstl_1882_0024.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
THE VAGUS NERVE. 1015 These facts alone make it probable that,that,rstl_1882_0024.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
synchronously with them. From these facts I conclude that atropin 8lows,that,rstl_1882_0024.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
Þ will not reconcile the facts observed. Calculation shows that decreasing,that,rstl_1882_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
the extra-limbic medulla. The above facts enable me to conelude that,that,rstl_1882_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
atoms of sulphaur. From these facts we conclude that the second,that,rstl_1882_0011.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
of his results on two facts : (1) that he took,that,rstl_1882_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22

although he holds that the facts aro in — favour of,that,rstl_1882_0008.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22

"back we find that the facts of embryology, if they show",that,rstl_1882_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
"are concerned. From the various facts adduced, it is evident that",that,rstl_1882_0029.txt,txt_rstl,1882,22
in the explanation of the facts ; that the liberal distribution,that,rstl_1883_0026.txt,txt_rstl,1883,22
"afforded by the two following facts : first, that in specimens",that,rstl_1883_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1883,22
into the supporting lamella. These facts leave no doubt that the,that,rstl_1883_0024.txt,txt_rstl,1883,22
does not account for the facts observed. I conclude that he,that,rstl_1884_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1884,22
"in many other Eases, the facts related show that at a",that,rstl_1884_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1884,22

that may be questionable. The facts of this experiment taken with,that,rstl_1884_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1884,22
"as well as other similar facts narrated, 8erve to show that",that,rstl_1884_0020.txt,txt_rstl,1884,22
In view of the above facts we can hardly doubt that,that,rstl_1885_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1885,22
appears desirable that the chief facts thus far acquired should at,that,rstl_1885_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1885,22
to call attention to the facts that whenever present they have,that,rstl_1885_0011.txt,txt_rstl,1885,22
brought to light the following facts among others — (1.) That,that,rstl_1885_0011.txt,txt_rstl,1885,22

"from physiological evidence, all anatomical facts being wanting. ‘3We believe that",that,rstb_1891_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1891,22
