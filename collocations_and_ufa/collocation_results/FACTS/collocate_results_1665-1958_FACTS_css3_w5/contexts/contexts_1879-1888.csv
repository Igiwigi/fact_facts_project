the interest attaching to these facts arises from the bearing which,these,rstl_1880_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1880,26

"2,000 to 2,500 feet. The facts may seem somewhat conflicting, but",to,rstl_1879_0077.txt,txt_rstl,1879,26
how we may explain these facts without having recourse to molecular,to,rstl_1879_0062.txt,txt_rstl,1879,26
is nothing antagonistic to known facts in the assumption that the,to,rstl_1879_0062.txt,txt_rstl,1879,26
whole visible -8pectrum. The following facts seem to me to prove,to,rstl_1879_0062.txt,txt_rstl,1879,26
A consideration of these experimental facts leads to the following conelusions,to,rstl_1879_0066.txt,txt_rstl,1879,26

"hypothesis is thus accepted, the facts which ib is adduced to",to,rstl_1880_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1880,26
thus fails to meet the facts of a rhythm which is,to,rstl_1880_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1880,26
a loss to interpret the facts in the case which I,to,rstl_1880_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1880,26

I should detail all the facts I have been able to,to,rstl_1880_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1880,26
the interest attaching to these facts arises from the bearing which,to,rstl_1880_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1880,26

the one most accordant with facts or not. That the discontinuous,the,rstl_1879_0062.txt,txt_rstl,1879,26
is nothing antagonistic to known facts in the assumption that the,the,rstl_1879_0062.txt,txt_rstl,1879,26
