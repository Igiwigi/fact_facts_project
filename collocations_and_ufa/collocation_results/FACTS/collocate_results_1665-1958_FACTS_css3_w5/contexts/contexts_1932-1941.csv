brain mentioned above. When the facts concerning the medial occipital region,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
inferior is definitely established. The facts become striking by comparing the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
harmony with the above. Two facts so far stand out :,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work of,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,27
any apical system known. The facts seem to be that these,the,rstb_1938_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27
"partial survival may occur, the facts indicate that the oviposition response",the,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

the living and non-living. The facts are there: we must adjust,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

the direction of Montserrat. These facts taken together suggest that the,the,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,27
one of the most far-reaching facts with which modern cytology has,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

In the light of the facts presented above it would appear,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

seemed profitable to publish the facts as they stand in the,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27

not agree with the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,27
necessary to re-examine both the facts and the lines of reasoning.,the,rstb_1940_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1940,27

in spite of all these facts the closed peripheral loops of,the,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
of the anatomy has revealed facts of a very unexpected nature.,the,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27

On the convexity the following facts may be noted In the,the,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27

OF THE CEREBRUM. Despite these facts it seems improbable that this,the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
"parieto-occipitalis is, if the above facts are valid, the upper end",the,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
to overlook the many interesting facts concerning colour change in this,the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
pallor. In view of these facts no general statement concerning the,the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
of this mechanism the following facts must be considered : (a),the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27

is afforded by the following facts :— 1. The prothoracic spiracles,the,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27

brain mentioned above. When the facts concerning the medial occipital region,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27

harmony with the above. Two facts so far stand out :,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work of,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,27
any apical system known. The facts seem to be that these,the,rstb_1938_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

independent of mitotic activity. The facts so far recorded relating to,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27
the living and non-living. The facts are there: we must adjust,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

the direction of Montserrat. These facts taken together suggest that the,the,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1938,27
one of the most far-reaching facts with which modern cytology has,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
"in the discussion, but no facts have so far been found",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
In the light of the facts presented above it would appear,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
here to account for the facts of chromosome elasticity. It should,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
possible the validity of the facts which have been used. This,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
seemed profitable to publish the facts as they stand in the,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
It is therefore to the facts in this paper rather than,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
"and ammoniated smears), the following facts among others have been elucidated:",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
at strepsitene. II. From these facts it is postulated that the,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
"Stempell (1899) and of the facts presented in this paper, to",the,rstb_1939_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

"here included, however, establishes the facts more definitely. The last row",the,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
One of the most striking facts which emerge is that when,the,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
particularly successful in correlating the facts when a liquid passes to,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
"sufficient to represent the observed facts with high accuracy, so that",the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
not agree with the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,27
necessary to re-examine both the facts and the lines of reasoning.,the,rstb_1940_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1940,27
the presence of Trias. These facts strongly suggest that the Lower,the,rsta_1940_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1940,27
the corresponding simple form. These facts suggest that we have here,the,rstb_1941_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1941,27
"required for melanin formation, the facts support the idea that we",the,rstb_1941_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1941,27
"and in accordance with the facts that could be ascertained, it",in,rstb_1932_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27

"is welcome in itself, the facts now brought to light are",in,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
in spite of all these facts the closed peripheral loops of,in,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
year. In view of these facts it seemed probable that the,in,rstb_1932_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
On the convexity the following facts may be noted In the,in,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
perhaps slightly more. The relevant facts are recorded and discussed in,in,rstb_1932_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
with some certainty. Thus the facts of association are strongly in,in,rstb_1932_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
In view of all these facts it appears highly probable that,in,rstb_1932_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
"in its position, in the facts that it often becomes fleshy,",in,rstb_1932_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
"however, to observe accurately certain facts which can be plotted in",in,rstb_1932_0017.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
"in face of all the facts furnished by comparative embryology, the",in,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
is amply substantiated by the facts and considerations set forth in,in,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
"so or not, the important facts remain that in both the",in,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
"modes of presentation of the facts of colour mixture, and in",in,rsta_1932_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1932,27
Every new group of observed facts must be put in its,in,rsta_1932_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1932,27
"character, x, of the observed facts were properly chosen—were, in fact,",in,rsta_1933_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1933,27
view. The explanation of these facts is seen in the slender,in,rstb_1934_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
to overlook the many interesting facts concerning colour change in this,in,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
pallor. In view of these facts no general statement concerning the,in,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
hypha. In conjunction with these facts it should be recalled that,in,rstb_1934_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
old. These similarities in experimental facts suggest a correspondence in the,in,rstb_1934_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
feature on the vertex. These facts are very clearly demonstrated in,in,rstb_1934_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
is perfectly true that the facts of eye-muscle development in birds,in,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
"Moreover, in addition to the facts that the extrinsic eye-muscles are",in,rstb_1934_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27

races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937,27
this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work of,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1937,27

"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1938,27

impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939,27

Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27

not agree with the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1939,27
One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1940,27
necessary to re-examine both the facts and the lines of reasoning.,the,rstb_1940_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1940,27

in spite of all these facts the closed peripheral loops of,the,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
of the anatomy has revealed facts of a very unexpected nature.,the,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27

On the convexity the following facts may be noted In the,the,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27
is on account of these facts that Kurz found the Chinese,the,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932,27

of this mechanism the following facts must be considered : (a),the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1934,27
