comparing these consequences with the facts to which the hypotheses are,to,rstl_1877_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1877,14

how we may explain these facts without having recourse to molecular,to,rstl_1879_0062.txt,txt_rstl,1879,14

A consideration of these experimental facts leads to the following conelusions,to,rstl_1879_0066.txt,txt_rstl,1879,14

"hypothesis is thus accepted, the facts which ib is adduced to",to,rstl_1880_0007.txt,txt_rstl,1880,14
