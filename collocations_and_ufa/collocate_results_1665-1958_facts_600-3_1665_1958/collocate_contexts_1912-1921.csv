Years 1912-1921: they confirm the facts and theories already,the
Years 1912-1921: the most important facts in the chain,the
Years 1912-1921: from the following facts :— (a) Microscopical,the
Years 1912-1921: by the following facts :-— 1. The,the
Years 1912-1921: bearing of the facts above set forth,the
Years 1912-1921: to regard the facts above set forth,the
Years 1912-1921: of all the facts brought to light,the
Years 1912-1921: will render these facts clear. The density,the
Years 1912-1921: to represent the facts in these extreme,the
Years 1912-1921: the result. The facts thus suggest the,the
Years 1912-1921: explained by the facts observed in other,the
Years 1912-1921: than 600. The facts just described throw,the
"Years 1912-1921: untenable, and the facts further seem to",the
Years 1912-1921: phenomena. The developmental facts presented later in,the
Years 1912-1921: Englishman illustrates these facts graphically. The characteristic,the
Years 1912-1921: drawn from these facts are of the,the
"Years 1912-1921: of the anatomical facts here set forth,",the
Years 1912-1921: most significant experimental facts bearing on the,the

Years 1912-1921: it the following facts become clear :—,the
Years 1912-1921: the most remarkable facts brought to light,the
Years 1912-1921: an illustration. The facts with regard to,the
Years 1912-1921: account for the facts in a way,the

Years 1912-1921: by the following facts :— 1. That,the
Years 1912-1921: far as the facts are shown. Laceocephalus,the
"Years 1912-1921: description of the facts in Amblystoma, has",the
Years 1912-1921: probably more. The facts recorded above suggest,the
Years 1912-1921: account for the facts observed. A provisional,the
Years 1912-1921: accordance with the facts that are at,the
Years 1912-1921: explain the observed facts of the phenomenon.,the
Years 1912-1921: believed that the facts already known are,the
Years 1912-1921: out the morphogenetic facts clearly. Whether this,the
Years 1912-1921: accord with observed facts than the one,the
"Years 1912-1921: ascertained from the facts of geological distribution,",the
Years 1912-1921: the light of facts and morphogenetic tendencies,the
Years 1912-1921: representation of the facts has led to,the
Years 1912-1921: deduction from experimental facts which record the,the
