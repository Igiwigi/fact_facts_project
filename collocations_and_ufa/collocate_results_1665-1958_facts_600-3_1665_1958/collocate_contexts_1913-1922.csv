Years 1913-1922: bearing of these facts on the .,the
Years 1913-1922: different lumen. The facts concerning our Kalymma,the
Years 1913-1922: court by the facts of distribution. On,the
Years 1913-1922: have stated the facts above at some,the
Years 1913-1922: ECHINOIDS. 329 The facts recorded in the,the

Years 1913-1922: the series. These facts strengthen the evidence,the
"Years 1913-1922: as regards the facts thus mentioned, this",the

Years 1913-1922: far as the facts are concerned I,the
Years 1913-1922: to express the facts (those of J.,the
Years 1913-1922: account for the facts up to a,the
Years 1913-1922: of the experimental facts presently to be,the
"Years 1913-1922: botany. Incidentally, the facts about to be",the
Years 1913-1922: know; but the facts are very striking.,the
Years 1913-1922: fit the striking facts that the species,the
Years 1913-1922: reflect upon the facts that have been,the
Years 1913-1922: bearings of the facts that have been,the
Years 1913-1922: support from the facts which have been,the
Years 1913-1922: do so. The facts of distribution would,the
Years 1913-1922: with the interesting facts which have been,the
Years 1913-1922: bearing of the facts here brought up,the
Years 1913-1922: bearing on the facts ascertained in this,the
Years 1913-1922: involves both the facts just stated. We,the
"Years 1913-1922: now, the above facts be combined with",the
"Years 1913-1922: hydroxylation theory, the facts comprised under (1)",the
Years 1913-1922: of carbon. The facts observed with the,the

"Years 1913-1922: from the above facts :— (1) That,",the
"Years 1913-1922: what the observed facts really are. Second,",the
Years 1913-1922: may represent the facts it can have,the
Years 1913-1922: Results. The general facts which have been,the
Years 1913-1922: From the foregoing facts we may conclude,the
Years 1913-1922: now to the facts which have led,the
Years 1913-1922: the megasporophylls. These facts seem to further,the
Years 1913-1922: they confirm the facts and theories already,the
Years 1913-1922: the most important facts in the chain,the
Years 1913-1922: from the following facts :— (a) Microscopical,the
Years 1913-1922: by the following facts :-— 1. The,the
Years 1913-1922: bearing of the facts above set forth,the
Years 1913-1922: to regard the facts above set forth,the
Years 1913-1922: of all the facts brought to light,the
Years 1913-1922: will render these facts clear. The density,the
Years 1913-1922: to represent the facts in these extreme,the
Years 1913-1922: the result. The facts thus suggest the,the
Years 1913-1922: explained by the facts observed in other,the
Years 1913-1922: than 600. The facts just described throw,the
"Years 1913-1922: untenable, and the facts further seem to",the
Years 1913-1922: phenomena. The developmental facts presented later in,the
Years 1913-1922: Englishman illustrates these facts graphically. The characteristic,the
Years 1913-1922: drawn from these facts are of the,the
"Years 1913-1922: of the anatomical facts here set forth,",the
Years 1913-1922: most significant experimental facts bearing on the,the
Years 1913-1922: results. The established facts which have an,the
Years 1913-1922: express the experimental facts exceedingly well for,the
Years 1913-1922: the list. These facts give some support,the
Years 1913-1922: it the following facts become clear :—,the
Years 1913-1922: the most remarkable facts brought to light,the
Years 1913-1922: an illustration. The facts with regard to,the
Years 1913-1922: account for the facts in a way,the
Years 1913-1922: that the chief facts relating to each,the
Years 1913-1922: the principal relevant facts regarding the daily,the
"Years 1913-1922: which represents the facts moderately well, though",the
Years 1913-1922: be equalised. The facts relating to the,the
Years 1913-1922: against another. The facts seem to indicate,the
Years 1913-1922: answered that the facts are confined to,the
"Years 1913-1922: Cretaceous Cheilostomes, the facts are as follows.",the
Years 1913-1922: out some further facts about the ribs,the
"Years 1913-1922: which genus the facts are not known,",the
Years 1913-1922: by the following facts :— 1. That,the
Years 1913-1922: far as the facts are shown. Laceocephalus,the
"Years 1913-1922: description of the facts in Amblystoma, has",the
Years 1913-1922: probably more. The facts recorded above suggest,the
Years 1913-1922: account for the facts observed. A provisional,the
Years 1913-1922: accordance with the facts that are at,the
Years 1913-1922: explain the observed facts of the phenomenon.,the
Years 1913-1922: believed that the facts already known are,the
Years 1913-1922: out the morphogenetic facts clearly. Whether this,the
Years 1913-1922: accord with observed facts than the one,the
"Years 1913-1922: ascertained from the facts of geological distribution,",the
Years 1913-1922: the light of facts and morphogenetic tendencies,the
Years 1913-1922: representation of the facts has led to,the
Years 1913-1922: deduction from experimental facts which record the,the
Years 1913-1922: of cleavage. “These facts are suggestive. The,the
Years 1913-1922: of the new facts brought to light,the
Years 1913-1922: of the new facts to guide a,the
Years 1913-1922: obtained increases. These facts confirm the theory,the
"Years 1913-1922: possible, from the facts for wood, to",the
Years 1913-1922: to relate the facts of the mechanical,the
Years 1913-1922: Potarisep Lica. The facts regarding the nature,the

Years 1913-1922: to explain the facts described above for,the
Years 1913-1922: in relation to facts derived from the,the
Years 1913-1922: of origin. Certain facts relevant to the,the
Years 1913-1922: Mutations. The essential facts in the preceding,the
Years 1913-1922: hypothesis fits the facts and explains them,the
