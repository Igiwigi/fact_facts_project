Years 1914-1923: the series. These facts strengthen the evidence,the
"Years 1914-1923: as regards the facts thus mentioned, this",the

Years 1914-1923: far as the facts are concerned I,the
Years 1914-1923: to express the facts (those of J.,the
Years 1914-1923: account for the facts up to a,the
Years 1914-1923: of the experimental facts presently to be,the
"Years 1914-1923: botany. Incidentally, the facts about to be",the
Years 1914-1923: know; but the facts are very striking.,the
Years 1914-1923: fit the striking facts that the species,the
Years 1914-1923: reflect upon the facts that have been,the
Years 1914-1923: bearings of the facts that have been,the
Years 1914-1923: support from the facts which have been,the
Years 1914-1923: do so. The facts of distribution would,the
Years 1914-1923: with the interesting facts which have been,the
Years 1914-1923: bearing of the facts here brought up,the
Years 1914-1923: bearing on the facts ascertained in this,the
Years 1914-1923: involves both the facts just stated. We,the
"Years 1914-1923: now, the above facts be combined with",the
"Years 1914-1923: hydroxylation theory, the facts comprised under (1)",the
Years 1914-1923: of carbon. The facts observed with the,the
Years 1914-1923: That the above facts do not really,the
"Years 1914-1923: carbon. Indeed, the facts harmonise very well",the
"Years 1914-1923: from the above facts :— (1) That,",the
"Years 1914-1923: what the observed facts really are. Second,",the
Years 1914-1923: may represent the facts it can have,the
Years 1914-1923: Results. The general facts which have been,the
Years 1914-1923: From the foregoing facts we may conclude,the
Years 1914-1923: now to the facts which have led,the
Years 1914-1923: the megasporophylls. These facts seem to further,the
Years 1914-1923: they confirm the facts and theories already,the
Years 1914-1923: the most important facts in the chain,the
Years 1914-1923: from the following facts :— (a) Microscopical,the
Years 1914-1923: by the following facts :-— 1. The,the
Years 1914-1923: bearing of the facts above set forth,the
Years 1914-1923: to regard the facts above set forth,the
Years 1914-1923: of all the facts brought to light,the
Years 1914-1923: will render these facts clear. The density,the
Years 1914-1923: to represent the facts in these extreme,the
Years 1914-1923: the result. The facts thus suggest the,the
Years 1914-1923: explained by the facts observed in other,the
Years 1914-1923: than 600. The facts just described throw,the
"Years 1914-1923: untenable, and the facts further seem to",the
Years 1914-1923: phenomena. The developmental facts presented later in,the
Years 1914-1923: Englishman illustrates these facts graphically. The characteristic,the
Years 1914-1923: drawn from these facts are of the,the
"Years 1914-1923: of the anatomical facts here set forth,",the
Years 1914-1923: most significant experimental facts bearing on the,the
Years 1914-1923: results. The established facts which have an,the
Years 1914-1923: express the experimental facts exceedingly well for,the
Years 1914-1923: the list. These facts give some support,the
Years 1914-1923: it the following facts become clear :—,the
Years 1914-1923: the most remarkable facts brought to light,the
Years 1914-1923: an illustration. The facts with regard to,the
Years 1914-1923: account for the facts in a way,the
Years 1914-1923: that the chief facts relating to each,the
Years 1914-1923: the principal relevant facts regarding the daily,the
"Years 1914-1923: which represents the facts moderately well, though",the
Years 1914-1923: be equalised. The facts relating to the,the
Years 1914-1923: against another. The facts seem to indicate,the
Years 1914-1923: answered that the facts are confined to,the
"Years 1914-1923: Cretaceous Cheilostomes, the facts are as follows.",the
Years 1914-1923: out some further facts about the ribs,the
"Years 1914-1923: which genus the facts are not known,",the
Years 1914-1923: by the following facts :— 1. That,the
Years 1914-1923: far as the facts are shown. Laceocephalus,the
"Years 1914-1923: description of the facts in Amblystoma, has",the
Years 1914-1923: probably more. The facts recorded above suggest,the
Years 1914-1923: account for the facts observed. A provisional,the
Years 1914-1923: accordance with the facts that are at,the
Years 1914-1923: explain the observed facts of the phenomenon.,the
Years 1914-1923: believed that the facts already known are,the
Years 1914-1923: out the morphogenetic facts clearly. Whether this,the
Years 1914-1923: accord with observed facts than the one,the
"Years 1914-1923: ascertained from the facts of geological distribution,",the
Years 1914-1923: the light of facts and morphogenetic tendencies,the
Years 1914-1923: representation of the facts has led to,the
Years 1914-1923: deduction from experimental facts which record the,the
Years 1914-1923: of cleavage. “These facts are suggestive. The,the
Years 1914-1923: of the new facts brought to light,the
Years 1914-1923: of the new facts to guide a,the
Years 1914-1923: obtained increases. These facts confirm the theory,the
"Years 1914-1923: possible, from the facts for wood, to",the
Years 1914-1923: to relate the facts of the mechanical,the
Years 1914-1923: Potarisep Lica. The facts regarding the nature,the

"Years 1914-1923: some extent, the facts described above in",the
Years 1914-1923: agreement with the facts derived from the,the
Years 1914-1923: to explain the facts described above for,the
Years 1914-1923: in relation to facts derived from the,the
Years 1914-1923: of origin. Certain facts relevant to the,the
Years 1914-1923: Mutations. The essential facts in the preceding,the
Years 1914-1923: hypothesis fits the facts and explains them,the
Years 1914-1923: stands. As the facts present themselves to,the
Years 1914-1923: oxygen consumed. The facts seem to us,the
Years 1914-1923: the light of facts which have since,the
"Years 1914-1923: | However, the facts at our disposal",the
Years 1914-1923: not accessible. The facts as here elucidated,the
Years 1914-1923: and co-ordinating the facts in a scheme,the
Years 1914-1923: illustration of the facts observed are treated,the
Years 1914-1923: and the observed facts are compared with,the
Years 1914-1923: below. The above facts indicate the lines,the
"Years 1914-1923: the number of facts sought, much of",the
Years 1914-1923: regard to the facts that (i.) the,the
Years 1914-1923: the paucity of facts gives freer play,the
Years 1914-1923: indicated by the facts now ascertained. During,the
Years 1914-1923: best describe the facts ? With regard,the
Years 1914-1923: its absence. The facts are the direct,the
"Years 1914-1923: error, the main facts stand out: (1)",the
Years 1914-1923: Rest. Whilst the facts given above are,the
Years 1914-1923: that the observed facts might be met,the
Years 1914-1923: upon the above facts seems to be,the
Years 1914-1923: accordance with the facts should have sprung,the
"Years 1914-1923: tion of the facts observed. When, however,",the
Years 1914-1923: account for the facts observed. This heterogeneity,the
Years 1914-1923: account for the facts observed on this,the
Years 1914-1923: From all these facts the conclusion may,the
Years 1914-1923: Hence the preceding facts may be summarised,the
