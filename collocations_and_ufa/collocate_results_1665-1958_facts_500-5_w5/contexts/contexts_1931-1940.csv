observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb

harmony with the above. Two facts so far stand out :,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work of,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta

"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb

impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb

Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta

One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb
necessary to re-examine both the facts and the lines of reasoning.,the,rstb_1940_0002.txt,txt_rstb

higher in the series. These facts afford substantial evidence for regarding,the,rstb_1931_0007.txt,txt_rstb
on larval emergence. All these facts support the conclusion of Dre,the,rstb_1931_0001.txt,txt_rstb
regard to the epipharynx the facts that it arises as a,the,rstb_1931_0001.txt,txt_rstb

The possible explanation of these facts we shall discuss later in,the,rstb_1931_0010.txt,txt_rstb
bands in their relations. The facts suggest that the head-process was,the,rstb_1931_0010.txt,txt_rstb
"is not satisfactory, the following facts could be recognised. The head-process",the,rstb_1931_0010.txt,txt_rstb
"with, the head-process. Whilst these facts seem to be quite certain,",the,rstb_1931_0010.txt,txt_rstb
is based on the following facts :— (1) Trawrra-Mosca states that,the,rstb_1931_0018.txt,txt_rstb

of this mechanism the following facts must be considered : (a),the,rstb_1934_0002.txt,txt_rstb

hygroscopic tent of saliva. These facts seem to indicate that the,the,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb
is afforded by the following facts :— 1. The prothoracic spiracles,the,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb

brain mentioned above. When the facts concerning the medial occipital region,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
inferior is definitely established. The facts become striking by comparing the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
harmony with the above. Two facts so far stand out :,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
races. Many interesting and suggestive facts emerge. In the lateral occipital,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb
this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work of,the,rsta_1937_0007.txt,txt_rsta

"partial survival may occur, the facts indicate that the oviposition response",the,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb
virulent type of reaction. These facts led to the view ITS,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb
independent of mitotic activity. The facts so far recorded relating to,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb
the living and non-living. The facts are there: we must adjust,the,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb

"hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb
"by alarming events. From the facts at our disposal, however, there",the,rstb_1938_0002.txt,txt_rstb
the direction of Montserrat. These facts taken together suggest that the,the,rsta_1938_0002.txt,txt_rsta
one of the most far-reaching facts with which modern cytology has,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are fully known.,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
observations on the type of facts to be used. Certain subjects,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
"seems however, clear from the facts for Osmunda. { These results",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb

here to account for the facts of chromosome elasticity. It should,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb

seemed profitable to publish the facts as they stand in the,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
It is therefore to the facts in this paper rather than,the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb
"and ammoniated smears), the following facts among others have been elucidated:",the,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb

One of the most striking facts which emerge is that when,the,rsta_1939_0009.txt,txt_rsta
Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical,the,rsta_1939_0004.txt,txt_rsta

One of the most important facts still to be discovered about,the,rstb_1940_0004.txt,txt_rstb
necessary to re-examine both the facts and the lines of reasoning.,the,rstb_1940_0002.txt,txt_rstb

on larval emergence. All these facts support the conclusion of Dre,of,rstb_1931_0001.txt,txt_rstb
types of early plant-remains. The facts ascer- tained also have their,of,rstb_1931_0009.txt,txt_rstb
the stem. Another set of facts concerns the terminal region. It,of,rstb_1931_0009.txt,txt_rstb
clothed with secretory emergences. The facts given in the body of,of,rstb_1931_0009.txt,txt_rstb
cases our knowledge of the facts is incomplete and needs to,of,rstb_1931_0009.txt,txt_rstb

The possible explanation of these facts we shall discuss later in,of,rstb_1931_0010.txt,txt_rstb

of the anatomy has revealed facts of a very unexpected nature.,of,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb
with that of Htapteris. These facts raise questions of nomenclature and,of,rstb_1932_0010.txt,txt_rstb
